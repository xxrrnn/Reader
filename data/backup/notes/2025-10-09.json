    "cfi": "{\"text\":\"China Dissent Monitor (CDM), a platform that tracks protests in China by analysing social media, has documented nearly 12,000 protests since June 2022. It counted more than 2,500 protests in the first six months of this year, a 73% increase over the same period last year (see chart). That may seem surprising in a country obsessed with surveillance and security. But it is possible that the government’s tight grip has squeezed formal channels of appeal through which Chinese citizens once felt able to air grievances. The sluggish economy seems to be another source of dissatisfaction. Labour protests, which are the most common type, have increased by 67%. Housing-related protests, conducted mostly by construction workers and contractors who haven’t been paid or by homebuyers whose purchased properties have been left unfinished, have doubled. The protests are almost certainly undercounted; many will have been censored before activists could track them.\",\"chapterTitle\":\"The surprising nature of protest in China\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"27\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_6/article_1/index_u60.html\",\"count\":\"12\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.25805110011734944\"}",
