    "cfi": "{\"text\":\"China Dissent Monitor (CDM), a platform that tracks protests in China by analysing social media, has documented nearly 12,000 protests since June 2022. It counted more than 2,500 protests in the first six months of this year, a 73% increase over the same period last year (see chart). That may seem surprising in a country obsessed with surveillance and security. But it is possible that the government’s tight grip has squeezed formal channels of appeal through which Chinese citizens once felt able to air grievances. The sluggish economy seems to be another source of dissatisfaction. Labour protests, which are the most common type, have increased by 67%. Housing-related protests, conducted mostly by construction workers and contractors who haven’t been paid or by homebuyers whose purchased properties have been left unfinished, have doubled. The protests are almost certainly undercounted; many will have been censored before activists could track them.\",\"chapterTitle\":\"The surprising nature of protest in China\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"27\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_6/article_1/index_u60.html\",\"count\":\"12\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.25805110011734944\"}",

China has reasons to be pleased. In contrast to the past, including during Mr Trump’s first presidency, the second Trump administration is not demanding structural changes to China’s economic model. “There is not the concerted effort to address overcapacity or to level the playing field for US companies,” she says. This time, American negotiators are more focused on “things important to the president”. That includes selling soyabeans and Boeing airliners and creating an America-only version of TikTok, a Chinese social-media app, perhaps by licensing its underlying technology to American investors. Ms Beran, now at Macro Advisory Partners, a consultancy, thinks that China was surprised when its move to curb exports of rare-earth minerals and permanent magnets proved “wildly successful”, panicking manufacturers worldwide. Against that, China should worry that its actions will prompt countries to seek diversified sources of vital inputs, she suggests.\",\"chapterTitle\":\"A made-in-China plan for world domination\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"65\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_12/article_1/index_u58.html\",\"count\":\"13\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.6797420503818483\"}",

    "text": "collaboration",
    "cfi": "{\"text\":\"The web was a fusion of two earlier technologies: the internet and hypertext, a way of organizing documents non-hierarchically through links. Hypertext dated to the nineteen-forties, when the science administrator Vannevar Bush wrote an article about a device that could represent knowledge “As Freely as We May Think.” By the eighties, the technologist Ted Nelson was trying, unsuccessfully, to build a universal hypertext library, which he called Project Xanadu. Berners-Lee’s more pragmatic idea was to use hypertext to enhance online collaboration. “Imagine making a large three-dimensional model, with people represented by little spheres, and strings between people who have something in common at work,” he wrote in a 1989 proposal.Colleagues at cern didn’t know what to make of the idea. “For many computer scientists . . . every document belonged in a specified container,” Berners-Lee writes. “I was proposing instead to free those documents—essentially to dump the files from their folders onto the floor.” A supervisor jotted “vague but exciting” on the proposal, and let him pursue it on the side. In October, 1990, Berners-Lee began laying the web’s foundations: HTML, the language of web pages; HTTP, the protocol that governed their transmission; and URLs, the addresses that linked them together. On August 6, 1991, the web’s first page, http://info.cern.ch, went online, introducing itself as “a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents.” Soon enough, there would be porn.In January, 1993, when I was born, there were about fifty web servers on the internet; new hosts customarily e-mailed Berners-Lee to let him know they were online. By my first birthday, there were six hundred, and this magazine had printed the now famous cartoon captioned “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” The first site I remember is Yahooligans, a Yahoo portal for children, where I played chess and downloaded screensavers. Next was Neopets, a virtual-pet game where my uncle, a former photo-lab technician, reinvented himself as a programmer. On the web, I read Jules Verne on Project Gutenberg, gave myself nightmares learning about Japanese war crimes in Manchuria, and laughed with a cousin at the crowdsourced recordings on farts.com. It was just as Berners-Lee wrote: “If you could put anything on it, then, after a while it would have everything on it.”My father, a songwriter and producer who built computers for his home studio, was quick to embrace the dot-com gospel. He bought domain names for everyone in the family and encouraged my early experiments in programming. At recess in middle school, while others played soccer or traded Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, I pored over tomes on HTML, JavaScript, and PHP—which paid off, socially, when I built a proxy server to let classmates access banned Flash games. Eventually, I started coding sites for local businesses, beginning with my mother’s. But it was exhausting to keep up with browsers’ rival implementations of the languages I’d learned.Fragmentation menaced the web from the outset. From CERN, it spread quickly through listservs, where enthusiasts shared proto-browsers to replace the bare-bones command-line program Berners-Lee had written. This was the kind of improvisation he’d hoped for. But it quickly got out of hand.One day, Berners-Lee had a listserv exchange with a college student named Marc Andreessen, who’d proposed an “<img>” tag to embed pictures in pages. Berners-Lee demurred, saying that he preferred more content-neutral syntax. But Andreessen wasn’t asking for his blessing. In 1993, he led the team that launched Mosaic, the first modern browser. The next year, he released a commercial successor, Netscape, whose I.P.O. made him an instant multimillionaire. Time put him on its cover—barefoot, leering, perched on a throne—and hailed him as a “Golden Geek.” (Time profiled Berners-Lee the next year, noting that unlike Andreessen, who drove a Mercedes, Berners-Lee drove an old Volkswagen; he jokingly blamed its carbon-monoxide emissions for the “diffuseness of his answers.”) Berners-Lee believed that Andreessen was trying to “hijack” his creation.His pique wasn’t just about money or ego. The web was meant to be universal, and had already outpaced similar networks. Kahle, the Internet Archive founder, had created WAIS, or the Wide Area Information Server, a publishing system with natural-language search. Another competitor was Gopher, developed at the University of Minnesota. Yet both relied on existing file formats and hierarchical menus. When Gopher tried to charge licensing fees, users fled. The web, by contrast, was free, easy to use, and, thanks to hypertext, infinitely flexible. “The markup language was simple,” Dan Connolly, who worked with Berners-Lee to codify HTML, told me. “And you didn’t have to ask your boss for money.”To keep it that way, Berners-Lee moved to the U.S. and founded W3C, in 1994. In time, the organization would open offices across the world, but its first home was at M.I.T., where it eventually settled into Frank Gehry’s flamboyant Stata Center, a jumble of towers and angles that appear to grow in several directions at once. The web, too, seemed in need of a stabilizing center—one that Berners-Lee doubted either he or the market could supply. A consortium, he writes, provided an alternative to “Balkanization and competing technical fiefdoms.” Companies were invited to shape the web collaboratively, through technical standards reached by consensus, and, later on, agreed not to sue one another over web technology.“Now he will wake up to a scar and edible flowers.”Cartoon by Anjali Chandrashekar“Tim used to call it ‘blue-helmet work,’ like U.N. peacekeepers,” Connolly said of the consortium’s early efforts. Its authority was constantly challenged. “These young engineers were saying, ‘Why do we need a consortium?’ ” Jean-François Abramatic, a former W3C chairman, recalled of an early meeting in San Francisco. “ ‘Why don’t we develop the best products and compete?’ ” But more enlightened self-interest won out. “They realized that the whole market was going to be much bigger if they coöperated,” Berners-Lee told me. He offered a nautical analogy: “When you sail a boat, there’s force on the sail and force on the keel.

Leith, an investor and a nonprofit director who co-founded a dot-com-era women’s portal called Flametree, greeted me at the door. “We’re basically guardians of the house,” she said, showing me its antique features. I almost missed Berners-Lee in the converted-barn kitchen, standing, expectantly, in a blue plaid shirt. He shook my hand, then glanced at Leith. “Are you a canoer?” she asked. Minutes later, he and I were gliding across a pond behind the house.\",\"chapterTitle\":\"Tim Berners-Lee Invented the World Wide Web.

And although students are happy to enroll in engineering degrees, that does not mean they are equally keen to get their hands dirty. According to a survey last year by Zhaopin, a recruitment agency, only 8% of students want to enter manufacturing. (Over a quarter want instead to go into IT, betraying a preference for bits over bolts.) Even among those who studied science or engineering, only 37% pursue engineering-related careers, according to an article in 2022 by Qin Fang and her colleagues at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu. \",\"chapterTitle\":\"China is the GOAT of engineering.

In the 2000s America grew alarmed at the prospect that A.Q. Khan, a leading Pakistani nuclear scientist who briefed Prince Sultan on that 1999 trip, might sell weapons technology to hostile states or jihadist groups. It would be ironic if Pakistan could now use its bomb as an instrument to shore up its diplomatic position. “It’s premature to say anything,” said Ishaq Dar, Pakistan’s foreign minister, “but some other countries want to enter into an agreement of this nature.”  ■\",\"chapterTitle\":\"Would you shelter under Pakistan’s nuclear umbrella?\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"22\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_5/article_0/index_u11.html\",\"count\":\"16\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.22093770471347912\"}",

    "cfi": "{\"text\":\"With barely a whimperIntroducing our new “wolf warrior” index on Chinese diplomacyChina’s officials snarl at the West much less than they used to 9月 18, 2025 07:17 上午\\nCHINA’S DIPLOMATS could hardly be more busy. More than 20 global leaders have descended on Beijing in recent weeks amid pomp and ceremony. An even greater show may be needed should President Donald Trump visit China next month. Talks between top Chinese and American officials in Spain in recent days suggest the idea is not an impossibility. Knowing exactly what to say, and in what tone, is critical amid all this excitement. Our new index shows that one diplomatic style, once favoured by Chinese bigwigs, will almost certainly be avoided: the “wolf warrior” posturing so prevalent in recent years.\\nThis confrontational diplomacy takes its name from the “Wolf Warrior” series of jingoistic blockbusters, in which Leng Feng, a kind of Chinese Rambo, fights off foreign baddies. One of its greatest practitioners was Zhao Lijian, the foreign ministry’s spokesperson from 2019 to 2023. He once told a Bloomberg journalist that members of the Five Eyes alliance should be careful, “lest their eyes be poked blind”.\\nWhy the shift to wolf-warring in the first place? It’s possible that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, wanted to stamp out any ideological laxity among the foreign ministry’s cadres, suggests Ito Asei of the University of Tokyo. It might also have been a distraction from China’s domestic woes, such as covid-19. Lu Shaye, China’s envoy to France from 2019 to 2025 and a prominent wolf warrior, argued it was simply “self-defence” against aggressive foreigners.\\nTo assess the current posture of China’s diplomacy, we downloaded all 16,000 press conference answers given by foreign-ministry spokespersons since 2018. We then asked ChatGPT to grade the belligerence of each on a scale from zero to one. The results—the “wolf warrior” index—show that China’s diplomatic rejoinders became sharply more bellicose starting in 2019 (see chart). Average aggressiveness rose from below 0.3 in 2018 to over 0.45 in May 2021. Since mid-2022, however, it has steadily fallen. By the beginning of this year, the foreign ministry’s language had softened to levels of cordiality not seen in the past six years or so.\\nMuch of the vitriol appears to have been hurled at America. We used an algorithm to chop the answers up into individual words, then looked at which ones appeared frequently in the most aggressive answers (those with an aggressiveness score above 0.7). The words “American-side” and “America” appeared in almost half of them. Other high-scorers include “security” (32%), “principles” (25%) and “sovereignty” (23%). Taiwan, which China insists is a matter of domestic politics, appeared in 16% of belligerent responses.\\nIn just a few short years the wolf warriors caused severe damage. Their comments triggered diplomatic blowback and soured relations with Australia and the EU, among others. Globally, public opinion on China tanked. An experiment run by Weifang Xu of Emory University in America found that although exposure to wolfish rhetoric increased Chinese support for the government, it antagonised Americans and made them favour aggressive policies towards China.\\nAll that probably influenced the decision to change tack. In 2021 Mr Xi chaired a study session that mulled building a “credible, lovable and respectable” image of China. “Economic concerns undoubtedly play a significant role,” argues Duan Xiaolin of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Perhaps the country’s diplomats did not want to scare off commercial partners in uncertain times. China has distanced itself from Mr Lu and other wolves as snarling seems less effective than smiling.■\\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China—and what China makes of the world.\",\"chapterTitle\":\"Introducing our new “wolf warrior” index on Chinese diplomacy\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"28\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_6/article_2/index_u46.html\",\"count\":\"1\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.263712055412915\"}",

Until then, the most common death toll cited by the media and the UN was 20,000, based on fatality figures compiled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), an America-registered monitor that tracks reports of political violence. But ACLED counts fatalities only when it has specific data for them, such as media reports. Adding those up can give only a lower range in a conflict, and often a poor one. According to a study in 2024 by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), more people were killed by bombs and bullets just in the capital, Khartoum, over the same period.

In his keynote speech to the DSA convention in 2023, he cited the pursuit of Palestinians’ rights, not those of American workers, as bringing him to the party: “The struggle for Palestinian liberation was at the core of my politics and continues to be.” He also said, because this is how American socialists, or private-college alumni, or both, evidently talk, “If socialism is our theory and DSA is our practice, then a committee is where they meet, or, as they say on Twitter, it is praxis.”\",\"chapterTitle\":\"Who’s afraid of the Democratic Socialists?\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"37\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_7/article_6/index_u59.html\",\"count\":\"14\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.3755325445069914\"}",
