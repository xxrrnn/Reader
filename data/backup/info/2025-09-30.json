It counted more than 2,500 protests in the first six months of this year, a 73% increase over the same period last year (see chart). That may seem surprising in a country obsessed with surveillance and security. But it is possible that the government’s tight grip has squeezed formal channels of appeal through which Chinese citizens once felt able to air grievances. The sluggish economy seems to be another source of dissatisfaction. Labour protests, which are the most common type, have increased by 67%. Housing-related protests, conducted mostly by construction workers and contractors who haven’t been paid or by homebuyers whose purchased properties have been left unfinished, have doubled. The protests are almost certainly undercounted; many will have been censored before activists could track them.\",\"chapterTitle\":\"The surprising nature of protest in China\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"27\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_6/article_1/index_u60.html\",\"count\":\"12\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.25805110011734944\"}",

The assembly might try to claim a greater role on matters of peace and security. Some of the UN’s specialised agencies—the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), say, or the International Civil Aviation Organisation—will probably live on. “You could see a fragmented form of multilateralism emerging, with no real political heart to it but lots of single-purpose agencies,” says Mr Gowan. “It would be mainly run out of Geneva or Nairobi, not Manhattan.”\",\"chapterTitle\":\"The UN’s grim future\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"61\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_12/article_0/index_u21.html\",\"count\":\"25\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.6242898644977174\"}",

Meanwhile, America’s foreign aid, much of it routed through voluntary contributions to UN humanitarian organisations, has been slashed. UN agency budgets have shrunk on average by about a third.

It would not be guaranteed American funds, but some of its agencies could benefit if, say, America decided that its refugee agency was useful to stem the flow of migrants. Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, argues that the Security Council, in particular, could become half-dead, with just the odd reflexive spasm, for example, to renew the mandate of UN peacekeepers in Cyprus. The assembly might try to claim a greater role on matters of peace and security. Some of the UN’s specialised agencies—the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), say, or the International Civil Aviation Organisation—will probably live on. “You could see a fragmented form of multilateralism emerging, with no real political heart to it but lots of single-purpose agencies,” says Mr Gowan. “It would be mainly run out of Geneva or Nairobi, not Manhattan.”\",\"chapterTitle\":\"The UN’s grim future\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"61\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_12/article_0/index_u21.html\",\"count\":\"25\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.6242898644977174\"}",

Traditionally, being a chef has meant long hours, few holidays, low pay and a hot, smoky kitchen. Few embrace such gruelling work. Centralising cooking thus makes sense, but it also takes romance away from the food. The growth of pre-made food has been, and will remain, tremendous. Industry analysts estimate that it generated revenue of 400bn yuan in 2022 and will exceed 1trn yuan next year. Vast improvements in China’s cold chain, from storage to distribution, have also helped to bring the experience of Xibei, and restaurants like it, into cities in the hinterland that were once underserved. The government, appreciating the importance of prepared food, drafted its first standards last year. But these were oddly structured: they defined pre-made food as reheatable pre-packaged dishes, so long as they do not include preservatives or come from central kitchens. (Perversely, restaurants using central kitchens and preservatives can thus claim not to be serving pre-made food, as officially defined.)\",\"chapterTitle\":\"A restaurant scandal sticks in China’s throat\",\"chapterDocIndex\":\"30\",\"chapterHref\":\"feed_6/article_3/index_u76.html\",\"count\":\"14\",\"page\":\"\",\"percentage\":\"0.3037132720977123\"}",
