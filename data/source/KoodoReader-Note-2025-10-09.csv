He was a very determined kid, and he decided to walk on his own to his cousin’s house. The problem was that it was on the other side of Pretoria, a walk of almost two hours. Plus, he was too young to read the road signs. “I kind of knew what the route looked like because I had seen it from a car, and I was determined to get there, so I just started walking,” he says. He managed to arrive just as the party was ending. When his mother saw him coming down the road, she freaked out. Fearing he would be punished again, he climbed a maple tree and refused to come down.

As about 85% of the protests seem to relate to issues affecting people’s personal finances, they usually target private companies and their bosses. Indeed, protesters frequently appeal to local or central authorities first. It is common to see demonstrators kowtowing before officials to beg for help. Most protesters resort to public dissent only after trying institutional methods of petitioning and appealing and finding them ineffective. Demonstrations that are not initially political can also become so if they are met with heavy-handed repression.
