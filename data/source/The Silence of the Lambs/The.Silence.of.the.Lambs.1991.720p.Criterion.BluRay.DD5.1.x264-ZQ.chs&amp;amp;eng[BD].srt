（维吉尼亚州匡蒂科附近森林）

2
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,117
史达琳！
Starling!

3
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,997
克劳福要见你
Crawford wants to see you
in his office.

4
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,062
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

5
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,066
（伤害）

6
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:23,267
（苦难）

7
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,468
（痛苦）

8
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,806
（喜欢它）

9
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:04,651
-克丽丝
-你好
-Clarice.
-Hey.

10
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:41,349
（行为科学组）

11
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:56,867
找克劳福吗？
Looking for Crawford?

12
00:04:57,073 --> 00:05:00,270
他快回来了
在他的办公室等一会吧
He should be back soon.
Why don't you wait in his office?

13
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,822
（比尔剥下第五个人的皮）

14
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,933
史达琳
Starling.

15
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:03,103
-克丽丝，早安
-早安，克劳福先生
-Clarice M. Good morning.
-Morning, Mr. Crawford.

16
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:06,605
抱歉突然把你召离课堂
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice.

17
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,744
你的导师说你是班里的高材生
Your instructors say you're
in the top quarter of your class.

18
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:13,275
希望是吧，他们还没有公布成绩
l hope so. They haven't posted
any grades yet.

19
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:16,049
有一个任务要办，于是我想起你
A job's come up,
and l thought about you.

20
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:18,880
这不是正式的任务
较像一份有趣的差事
Not a job, really,
more of an interesting errand.

21
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:20,281
坐下
Sit down.

22
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:21,845
是，长官
Yes, sir.

23
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:25,319
我记得你出席过
我在维吉尼亚大学的讲座
l remember you from my seminar at UVA.

24
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:31,529
你追问我本局在胡佛年代的
公民权益记录
You grilled me on the bureau's civil
rights record in the Hoover years.

25
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:32,722
我给了你甲等
l gave you an A.

26
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,327
是甲下
A minus, sir.

27
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:40,266
双主修，心理学及犯罪学
以优异成绩毕业
Double major, psych and criminology,
graduated magna.

28
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:43,239
在瑞辛格疗养院做过夏季实习
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

29
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:48,211
它说你毕业后
想在行为科学组替我工作
lt says when you graduate you want
to work for me in Behavioral Science.

30
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,474
是的，我很想
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

31
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:54,487
我们正在访问被囚禁的连环杀手
We're interviewing
all serial killers in custody...

32
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,520
作变态行为的分析
...for a psycho-behavioral profile.

33
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,518
对一些悬案会有很大帮助
lt could be a real help
in unsolved cases.

34
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:02,287
他们大都乐意跟我们谈
Most of them have been happy
to talk to us.

35
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,422
你会否很易受惊的？
Do you spook easily, Starling?

36
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,562
不会
Not yet, sir.

37
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,663
我们最想见的那个人拒绝合作
The one we want most refuses to help.

38
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:12,305
我想你去精神病院找他
l want you to go after him
in the asylum.

39
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,138
那个人是谁？
Who's the subject?

40
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:18,812
-心理医生汉内达莱达
-食人狂魔汉内达
-The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.
-''Hannibal the Cannibal.''

41
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:21,607
我想他不会跟你交谈
l don't expect him to talk to you...

42
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:25,818
但无论如何我们都得尝试
...but l have to be able
to say we tried.

43
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,985
若他不合作，我要如实报告
lf he won't cooperate,
l want straight reporting.

44
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,021
他的容貌和监狱里的状况如何？
How's he look? How's his cell?

45
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:34,786
他有没有素描、绘画？
如果有，他都画些什么？
ls he sketching, drawing?
lf he is, what's he sketching?

46
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,295
这是莱达的档案...
Here's a dossier on Lecter...

47
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,473
问卷副本和你的身分证
...copy of our questionnaire
and an l.D. for you.

48
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:49,666
周三早上八点把你的报告交给我
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800, Wednesday.

49
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:51,037
好的
Okay.

50
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:56,640
对不起，为什么这样急？
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

51
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,580
莱达已经坐牢很多年了
Lecter's been in prison for years.

52
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:01,880
他和水牛比尔是否有关连？
ls there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill?

53
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,924
但愿有，我要你非常留意
l wish there were. Now, l want
your full attention, Starling.

54
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:10,553
-知道
-要非常小心应付莱达汉内堡
-Yes, sir.
-Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

55
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:15,195
精神病院的奇顿医生
会给你讲解接见程序
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over
all the physical procedures used.

56
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:19,298
无论如何不可偏离程序
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

57
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,566
你不可向他透露私人事情
You're to tell him nothing personal.

58
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,179
你不想汉内堡莱达知道你的思想的
You don't want Hannibal Lecter
inside your head.

59
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,542
执行你的任务
但千万别忘记他的身分
Just do your job
but never forget what he is.

60
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:30,109
是什么？
And what is that?

61
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:34,482
他是个魔头，一个变态狂人
Oh, he's a monster, a pure psychopath.

62
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,081
可以生擒一个已很难得了
lt's so rare to capture one alive.

63
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:41,318
从研究角度来说
莱达是我们最有价值的资产
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

64
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,224
我们有很多探员来这里的
We get a lot of detectives here...

65
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:50,700
但我记不起有这样漂亮的一个
...but l must say l can't remember
one as attractive.

66
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,740
你会在巴尔的摩过夜吗？
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

67
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:59,709
如果你有适当的向导
这可以是个很好玩的城市
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

68
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:04,482
我肯定这是个了不起的城市
l'm sure this is a great town,
Dr. Chilton...

69
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:08,553
但我要见莱达医生
下午还要回去报告
...but l must talk to Dr. Lecter
and report back this afternoon.

70
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,324
是的，那么我们快点吧
l see. Well, let's make
this quick, then.

71
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:17,087
我们尝试研究他，但他太高深了
一般的测试都不适用
We've tried to study him, but he's too
sophisticated for the standard tests.

72
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:19,528
他很讨厌我们的
Oh, my, does he hate us.

73
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:21,827
他觉得我是他的报应
He thinks l'm his nemesis.

74
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:26,032
克劳福真是聪明，他利用你
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

75
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,640
-什么意思？
-找个漂亮的女郎来引诱他
-What do you mean, sir?
-Pretty young woman to turn him on.

76
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:36,082
我相信这八年来莱达都没见过女人
而你正合他的胃口
l don't believe Lecter's seen a woman
in eight years, and you are his taste.

77
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:37,782
恕我直言
So to speak.

78
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:40,920
我毕业于维吉尼亚大学
它不是一间仪态学校
l graduated from UVA.
lt's not a charm school.

79
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,387
很好，你该能记着那些规矩了
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

80
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:51,129
不要触摸或接近那块玻璃
只可传递柔软的纸张给他
Do not touch or approach the glass.
Pass him nothing but soft paper.

81
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:55,063
不可有铅笔或原子笔
纸张上不可有钉书钉或夹子
No pencils or pens, no staples
or paper clips in his paper.

82
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,601
只可用那个活动食物架传送
Use the sliding food carrier,
no exceptions.

83
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,000
不可接受他给你的东西
lf he passes you anything,
do not accept.

84
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,676
-明白吗？
-明白
-Do you understand?
-Yes, l understand, sir.

85
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:07,238
我让你看看
为何我们要有这些戒备
l'm going to show you why we insist
on such precautions.

86
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:09,916
在1981年7月8日的下午
On the afternoon of July 8, 1 981 ...

87
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:13,019
他说胸口痛，被带往医疗室
...he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

88
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,689
为方便做心电图
他的口罩被除下
His mouthpiece was removed for an EKG.

89
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,882
当护士靠近他身边时
他对她做了这个
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

90
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:26,065
医生们算是重整了她的下颚
和救回她一只眼睛
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less. Save one of her eyes.

91
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:31,163
即使在他吃她的舌头时
他的脉搏从没超过85
His pulse never got above 85,
even when he ate her tongue.

92
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:35,306
-我把他关在这里
-奇顿医生
-l keep him in here.
-Dr. Chilton.

93
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:41,472
若莱达觉得你是他的敌人，那么...
lf Lecter feels
that you're his enemy, then....

94
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,082
若我单独去的话
我们运气可能会好一点
Maybe we'll have more luck
if l go by myself.

95
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:45,783
你认为如何？
What do you think?

96
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,420
你若在我办公室时提出来
就可省掉我的时间了
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

97
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:57,889
是的，但我会错过了
你同行的乐趣
Yes, sir, but then l would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

98
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,103
她完事后带她出去吧
When she's finished, bring her out.

99
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:36,260
你好，我是巴尼
他说过了，不要走近那块玻璃
Hi, l'm Barney. He told you,
don't get near the glass?

100
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:38,736
对，他说过了
我是克丽丝史达琳
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

101
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,600
幸会，你可以把大衣挂在那里
Nice to meet you. You can hang
your coat there if you like.

102
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,005
好的，谢谢你
Okay. Thank you, l will.

103
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,641
他在最尽头的那个牢房
He's past the others.
The last cell.

104
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,613
靠右走吧
You keep to the right.

105
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:57,457
-我放了一张椅子给你
-很好，谢谢你
-l put out a chair for you.
-Yes, that's very good, thank you.

106
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:02,763
我会看着，你不会有事的
l'll be watching. You'll do fine.

107
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:34,951
我可以闻到你的私处
l can smell your cunt.

108
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:50,065
早安
Good morning.

109
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:54,846
莱达医生，我叫克丽丝史达琳
可否跟你谈一会？
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice
Starling. May l speak with you?

110
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:57,178
你是克劳福的人，是吗？
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

111
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:58,742
是的
l am, yes.

112
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:01,885
可否看看你的证件？
May l see your credentials?

113
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:03,543
当然可以
Certainly.

114
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,387
靠近一点，劳烦你
Closer, please.

115
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,823
近一点
Closer.

116
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:36,310
一周内后就到期了
你不是真的联邦调查局探员吧
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBl, are you?

117
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:39,256
我仍在受训
l'm still in training at the academy.

118
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:45,395
-克劳福派个见习生来见我？
-是的，我是个学生
-Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
-Yes, l'm a student.

119
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,621
我是来向你学习的
l'm here to learn from you.

120
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:51,029
也许你可以决定
我是否够资格这样做
Maybe you can decide
if l'm qualified enough to do that.

121
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:57,566
你很不老实呢，史达琳探员
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

122
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,773
请坐
Sit. Please.

123
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:14,147
告诉我，迈克斯对你说了什么？
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

124
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,953
隔壁的“多面人迈克斯”
''Multiple Miggs'' in the next cell.

125
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:20,290
他向你发出嘶嘶声
他说了些什么？
He hissed at you. What did he say?

126
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,635
他说“我可以闻到你的私处”
He said, ''l can smell your cunt.''

127
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:26,265
是吧
l see.

128
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:29,631
我可闻不到
l myself cannot.

129
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:41,345
你用爱肤恩润肤膏
You use Evyan skin cream.

130
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:46,757
有时你会涂点香水
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

131
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,683
但今天没有
But not today.

132
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:53,760
这些画是你画的吗？
Did you do all these drawings?

133
00:14:56,835 --> 00:15:00,202
那是从观景楼远望的大教堂
That is the Duomo, seen
from the Belvedere.

134
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:03,234
你知道佛罗伦斯吗？
Do you know Florence?

135
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,177
那些细节都是来自记忆的吗？
All that detail just from memory, sir?

136
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:10,972
史达琳探员，
我只有记忆，没有景观
Memory, Agent Starling, is what
l have instead of a view.

137
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:16,279
你可在这份问卷上
给我们一些见解
Perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

138
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:20,925
不...你做得很好
No, no, no. You were doing fine.

139
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:24,118
你很有礼，而且能容纳礼貌
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

140
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:28,789
你对迈克斯的尴尬说话
也表现得很信任
You had established trust with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

141
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:33,664
至于你这份拙劣的问卷
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

142
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:36,271
就不行了
lt won't do.

143
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:40,611
我只是要求你看看它
你做不做随便你
l'm only asking you to look at this.
Either you will or you won't.

144
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:44,474
对，若克劳福要从学校找人帮忙
Yeah. Jack Crawford must be
very busy indeed...

145
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:47,208
他一定很忙了
...if he's recruiting help
from the student body.

146
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:50,281
忙于追捕那个新手水牛比尔吧
Busy hunting that new one,
Buffalo Bill.

147
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,786
他真是个坏孩子
What a naughty boy he is.

148
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:56,456
你可知道为何他
被称为水牛比尔？
Do you know why he's called
''Buffalo Bill''?

149
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:59,994
请告诉我，报纸上没有说
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.

150
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,464
是来自堪萨斯城
凶案组的一个笑话
lt started as a joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

151
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:07,900
他们说
“这个人喜欢剥他猎物的皮”
They said, ''This one likes
to skin his humps.''

152
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,537
史达琳探员，你认为为什么...
Why do you think...

153
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:14,542
他要剥她们的皮？
...he removes their skins,
Agent Starling?

154
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:17,010
用你的敏锐来振奋我一下吧
Thrill me with your acumen.

155
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:19,374
这样做令他兴奋
lt excites him.

156
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:22,644
大部分的连环杀手都会保存
受害人身上的东西作为纪念品
Most serial killers keep
trophies from their victims.

157
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:25,548
-我可没有
-对
-l didn't.
-No.

158
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:27,424
你吃了他们
No, you ate yours.

159
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:32,195
把那个传过来吧
You send that through now.

160
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:03,693
你以为凭这份拙劣的东西
便可以分析我？
You think you can dissect
me with this blunt little tool?

161
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:07,294
不是！我相信你的学识...
No! l thought
that your knowledge--

162
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:09,797
你很有野心，是不是？
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

163
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:13,795
可知道你拿着那个高级皮包
和穿着廉价鞋子像个什么？
You know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

164
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:15,438
像个土包子
You look like a rube.

165
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:20,237
一个干净、忙碌
带点品味的土包子
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

166
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:23,275
虽然你衣食无忧地成长...
Nutrition has given you
some length of bone...

167
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,644
你不外乎是个白种低下层的人
...but you're not more than one
generation from white trash...

168
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:28,682
是不是，史达琳探员？
...are you, Agent Starling?

169
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,685
你极力想摆脱口音...
The accent you've tried
so desperately to shed...

170
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,949
地道的西维吉尼亚州腔调
...pure West Virginia.

171
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:36,218
你父亲是个矿工吗？
ls your father a coal miner?

172
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:38,157
那盏灯可有令他满身臭气？
Does he stink of the lamp?

173
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:43,229
我知道那些男孩怎样迅速搭上你
在汽车后座里乱摸
l know how quickly the boys found you,
all those tedious, sticky fumblings...

174
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:46,871
你却想着走出去
...in the back seats of cars,
while you dreamed of getting out.

175
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,436
走去天涯海角
Getting anywhere.

176
00:17:48,706 --> 00:17:52,267
直走到联邦调查局
Getting all the way to the FBl.

177
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,378
你很有观察力
You see a lot, doctor.

178
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,051
但你能否用你敏锐的观察力...
But are you strong enough
to point that...

179
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:03,777
来分析自己？
...high-powered
perception at yourself?

180
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:05,915
怎么样？
What about it?

181
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:10,288
不如你探究一下自己
把观察所得写下来
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

182
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:12,224
或者你害怕这样做吧
Or maybe you're afraid to.

183
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:24,873
曾经有一个人口调查员想测试我
A census taker once tried to test me.

184
00:18:25,076 --> 00:18:28,409
我把他的肝配蚕豆吃了
l ate his liver
with some fava beans...

185
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:30,911
还有美味的红酒呢
...and a nice Chianti.

186
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:42,090
小史达琳，你飞回学校去吧
You fly back to school now,
little Starling.

187
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:44,484
飞吧...
Fly, fly, fly.

188
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:01,377
我咬我的手腕...
l bit my wrist...

189
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:05,049
让我可以死掉
...so l could die.

190
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,311
看这些血
Look at the blood!

191
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,650
吓到你了
Gotcha.

192
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:11,146
迈克斯！你这个混蛋！
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

193
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,528
史达琳探员！回来！史达琳探员
Agent Starling! Come back!
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

194
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,824
我不会让那种事情再发生
我讨厌不礼貌的
l would not have had that happen.
Discourtesy is ugly to me.

195
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:25,468
-那么做这个测验吧
-不做，但我会令你开心的
-Then do this test!
-No, but l will make you happy.

196
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,195
-我会给你一个大好机会
-什么？
-l'll give you a chance at your love.
-What?

197
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:33,173
升职，听着
你自我反省一下，克丽丝史达琳
Advancement. Listen. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.

198
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:37,575
找出我从前的病人莫菲小姐
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

199
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:40,407
我相信迈克斯不会这么快发作的...
l don't think Miggs could
manage again so soon...

200
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:42,848
虽然他是疯的，快去
...even though he is crazy.
Go now!

201
00:20:24,362 --> 00:20:25,556
你好，比尔
Hi, Bill.

202
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,063
-爸爸
-克丽丝
-Daddy!
-Hey, Clarice.

203
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:39,834
-爸爸，你有没有抓到坏人？
-没有，他们跑掉了
-Did you get any bad guys, Daddy?
-No, angel. They all got away.

204
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,534
该死
Ah, shoot.

205
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:04,163
联邦调查局，举手，别动！
FBl! Hands up! Don't move!

206
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:07,895
转过身来，把双手放在后面
好的
Turn around. Hands behind your back.
Thumbs up.

207
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:13,706
史达琳，你已经死了
You're dead, Starling.

208
00:21:14,245 --> 00:21:18,375
强生，进入和指挥都做得很好
史达琳，你哪里有危险？
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

209
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:19,981
-在角落
-你有没有检查过它？
-ln the corner.
-Did you check it?

210
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:21,776
-没有，长官
-所以你已经死了
-No, sir.
-That's why you're dead.

211
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:25,112
3109？
3-1 -0-9?

212
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:29,760
打破门或窗闯入或者撤退
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.

213
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:31,990
404号规条呢？
Rule 404?

214
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,861
（巴尔的摩心理医生
获得最高荣誉）

215
00:21:38,402 --> 00:21:40,461
（著名心理医生被控谋杀）

216
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,776
（食人狂魔审讯带来新的恐怖）

217
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:53,180
克丽丝，你的电话，是教官
Clarice, phone. lt's the guru.

218
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:55,011
克劳福？谢谢，雅戴
Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

219
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,920
-史达琳？
-长官
-Starling?
-Sir.

220
00:21:58,122 --> 00:21:59,555
迈克斯死了
Miggs is dead.

221
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:01,714
死了？
Dead?

222
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:03,821
怎会的？
How?

223
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:07,622
守卫听到汉内堡莱达
下午时对他低声说话
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon.

224
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:10,426
他们在夜间巡查时
发现他吞掉自己的舌头
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his tongue.

225
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:14,563
史达琳？
Starling?

226
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:18,132
我还在听，我只是...
Yeah. l'm still here, sir. l just--

227
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:20,071
我不知道对这件事该有何感想
l don't know how to feel about this.

228
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:24,080
你不用感想什么
莱达这样做只是为了自娱
You don't have to feel any way.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

229
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,350
我明白今天很难受
Look, l know it got ugly today...

230
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:32,219
但你提到莫菲，有后续行动吗？
...but you mentioned a name,
''Mofet.'' Any follow-up on her?

231
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:37,021
他在被捕前
把大部分病人的病历销毁了
He destroyed most of his patients'
histories prior to capture...

232
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:40,720
所以没有莫菲的记录
...so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet.

233
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:45,027
我觉得“你自己”这个参考资料
对莱达来说太造作了
But l thought the ''yourself' reference
was too hokey for Lecter...

234
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:49,400
我想起他是来自巴尔的摩
便翻查电话簿
...so l figured he's from Baltimore,
and l looked in the phone book.

235
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:52,872
那里有一间叫“你自己”的
自助式仓库
And there's a
''Your Self' storage facility...

236
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:55,568
在巴尔的摩市外围
...right outside
of downtown Baltimore, sir.

237
00:22:57,782 --> 00:23:00,012
31号仓已经租了十年...
Unit 31 was leased...

238
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:03,482
租金是全数预缴的
...for 1 0 years, prepaid in full.

239
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,621
合约是以一个...
The contract was in the name...

240
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:09,589
是莫菲赫斯达小姐的人定的
...of a Miss Hester Mofet.

241
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:12,422
自从1980年就没有人来过了？
So nobody's been
in here since 1 980?

242
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,427
以我所知是没有
Not to my knowledge.

243
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,765
我的顾客都很重视私隐权的
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

244
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:21,596
对，我答应不会扰乱任何东西
Yes, l won't disturb anything,
l promise.

245
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:23,831
我很快便会离开
l'll be out of here
before you know it.

246
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,673
-要帮忙吗？
-好的
-May l help you?
-Yes, actually.

247
00:23:27,044 --> 00:23:28,033
这里
Here.

248
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:36,578
-它被卡着
-明天可以叫我的儿子来
-lt's stuck.
-We could return tomorrow with my son.

249
00:23:37,388 --> 00:23:38,878
他怎么样？
What about him?

250
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:45,228
我本可叫我的司机帮你
但他讨厌体力劳动
l would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor.

251
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:46,954
是吧
Right.

252
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:50,293
你别走开，我很快回来
You stay here.
l'll be back in one minute.

253
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,527
它被卡着，请你把那支电筒给我
lt's stuck. Will you hand me
that flashlight?

254
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:42,715
如果这道门跌下来...
lf this door should fall down...

255
00:24:43,254 --> 00:24:45,688
或者有什么意外...
...or anything else...

256
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,154
这是我们巴尔的摩办公室的
电话号码
...this is the number
for our Baltimore office.

257
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,319
他们知道你跟我在一起的
They know that you're with me.

258
00:24:50,628 --> 00:24:54,223
-如果有意外就找他们吧
-好的，史达琳小姐
-Call them if anything should happen.
-Yes, Miss Starling.

259
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:28,040
克丽丝，他们在等你
Clarice. Here, they're waiting
for you.

260
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:29,775
小心
Watch your step.

261
00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:35,014
“莫菲赫斯达”是拼字猜谜吧？
Hester Mofet. lt's an anagram,
isn't it, doctor?

262
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:38,217
意思是“我其余的东西”
Hester Mofet: ''The rest of me''?

263
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:42,564
那表示车库是你租的？
''Miss The Rest Of Me,'' meaning
that you rented that garage?

264
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:19,426
谢谢
Thank you.

265
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:21,968
你止血了
Your bleeding has stopped.

266
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:25,634
怎么...？
How did...?

267
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:28,668
没有大碍的
lt's nothing.

268
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:30,879
只是皮外伤
lt's just a scratch.

269
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:34,746
莱达医生，那瓶里的头颅是谁的？
Dr. Lecter, whose head
is in that bottle?

270
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:38,079
为什么你不问我
关于水牛比尔的事？
Why don't you ask me
about Buffalo Bill?

271
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:39,982
你知道他的事？
Do you know something about him?

272
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:43,920
如果我看过档案可能知道的
你可以替我拿
l might if l saw the case file.
You could get that for me.

273
00:28:44,494 --> 00:28:47,463
谈谈莫菲小姐吧
你要我去找他
Let's talk about Miss Mofet.
You wanted me to find him.

274
00:28:48,598 --> 00:28:53,592
他的真名是班哲文赖普
是我的前病患
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.
A former patient of mine...

275
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:58,733
他的恋爱对象，有点怪异
...whose romantic attachments
ran to, shall we say, the exotic.

276
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:03,541
我没有杀他，只是把他藏起来
就像我发现他时的样子
l did not kill him, merely tucked
him away, very much as l found him...

277
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:06,113
在他错过了三次约会之后
...after he'd missed
three appointments.

278
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,409
若你没有杀他，那么是谁杀？
lf you didn't kill him, who did?

279
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,721
谁知道？对他来说是件好事
Who can say?
Best thing for him, really.

280
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:15,323
他的治疗没有功效
His therapy was going nowhere.

281
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:18,920
他的裙子、化妆...
His dress, makeup....

282
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:20,954
赖普是个异性装扮癖好者？
Raspail was a transvestite?

283
00:29:21,164 --> 00:29:25,828
生活上？不是
只是普通的躁狂抑郁
ln life? Oh, no.
Garden variety manic-depressive.

284
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:28,504
乏味，非常乏味
Tedious, very tedious.

285
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:31,105
现在我把他看成是一个实验
l now think of him as an experiment.

286
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:34,833
一个没经验的杀手尝试转变
A fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.

287
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:37,843
你看到他时有何感觉？
How did you feel when you saw him,
Clarice?

288
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:40,149
初时很害怕，后来...
Scared at first, then...

289
00:29:41,218 --> 00:29:42,515
便很振奋
...exhilarated.

290
00:29:43,153 --> 00:29:45,348
克劳福在提拔你，是吗？
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

291
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:48,285
看来你们互相倾慕呢
Apparently, he likes you
and you like him too.

292
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,754
我从没有想过
l never thought about it.

293
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:53,956
你认为克劳福对你有遐想吗？
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

294
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:59,295
他年纪大很多
你对他可有想入非非？
He is much older, but do you think
he visualizes scenarios, exchanges?

295
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:00,663
跟你做爱？
Fucking you?

296
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,837
我没有兴趣
这是迈克斯会说的那种话
That doesn't interest me. lt's the
sort of thing that Miggs would say.

297
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:12,405
不再是了
Not anymore.

298
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:21,650
谢谢你，巴尼
Thank you, Barney.

299
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,553
你的画呢？
What happened to your drawings?

300
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:33,568
惩罚，为了迈克斯那件事
像那个传道节目...
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel program.

301
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:36,668
你离开后他们就会调高声音
When you leave, they'll turn
the volume way up.

302
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:40,170
奇顿医生喜欢这些折磨伎俩
Dr. Chilton does enjoy
his petty torments.

303
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:43,207
你说转变是什么意思？
What did you mean
by ''transformation,'' doctor?

304
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:55,722
克丽丝，我在这里八年了
l've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

305
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:59,460
我知道在我有生之年
他们都不会释放我
l know they will never
ever let me out while l'm alive.

306
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:02,424
我想要的是一个景观
What l want is a view.

307
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:06,432
我想要一个看到树和水的窗户
l want a window where l can see a tree
or even water.

308
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:10,265
我想去一间远离
奇顿医生的联邦监狱
l want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

309
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:12,839
你说“没经验的杀手”
是什么意思？
What did you mean
by ''fledgling killer''?

310
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,874
你是否说他已经再次杀人？
Are you saying he's killed again?

311
00:31:15,178 --> 00:31:18,375
我根据案件的证据
给你对水牛比尔...
l'm offering you a psychological
profile on Buffalo Bill...

312
00:31:18,582 --> 00:31:20,675
作心理分析
...based on the case evidence.

313
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:35,197
我会帮你抓到他的
l'll help you catch him, Clarice.

314
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:37,256
你知道他是谁，是不是？
You know who he is, don't you?

315
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:40,863
告诉我谁把你的病人斩首了
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, doctor.

316
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:43,867
愿意等待的人都有好报的
All good things to those who wait.

317
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:48,435
我已经等了
但杰克能等多久？
l've waited, Clarice. But how long
can you and old Jackie-boy wait?

318
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:54,176
我们的小比尔一定正在找寻着
下一位特别的女士了
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady.

319
00:31:57,953 --> 00:32:01,787
（田纳西州孟斐斯市）

320
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:59,439
小猫咪
Hey, little cheeper.

321
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:09,448
我快来了
l'll be right there.

322
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:30,074
天啊！
Jeez!

323
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:37,845
要我帮忙吗？
Can l help you with that?

324
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:39,954
可以吗？
Would you?

325
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:41,247
当然可以
Sure.

326
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:42,854
谢谢你
Thank you.

327
00:33:43,058 --> 00:33:45,356
不用客气，你好像是伤残人士
That's all right. You look
kind of handicapped.

328
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:49,554
是的，我搬到这里但搬不上货车
Yeah. l got it this far, l just can't
get it up in the truck by myself.

329
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:51,630
来吧，抓着，上！
Here, grab this. Up!

330
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,025
好的
Okay.

331
00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:55,635
把它放下吧，很好
Just set it down. That's good.

332
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:59,637
你上车，我想把它推进去
Get in the truck. l want to
push it all the way up.

333
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,934
真的很谢谢你
l really appreciate this.
Thank you.

334
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:06,512
放到后面去
Just go all the way back.

335
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:08,780
行了吗？
Okay. ls this good?

336
00:34:08,984 --> 00:34:10,815
行了，很好
Yeah, that's good.

337
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:14,017
-真好
-好的
-That's great.
-Okay.

338
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:17,347
你大概穿十四号吧？
Say, are you
about a size 1 4?

339
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,719
什么？
Sorry?

340
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,775
（十四号）

341
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:41,279
好
Good.

342
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:03,564
好极了...
Oh, good. Good.

343
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:20,520
抓着
Holds!

344
00:35:23,025 --> 00:35:24,617
一！
Ones!

345
00:35:32,768 --> 00:35:34,395
史达琳！
Starling!

346
00:35:36,738 --> 00:35:39,206
出去，我们走吧
Outside. Let's go.

347
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:42,975
仙蒂，进场代替史达琳，来吧
Cindy, in the ring for Starling.
Let's go!

348
00:35:52,788 --> 00:35:54,085
收拾你的装备
Pack your field gear.

349
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:55,984
-我们会跟克劳福一起去
-去哪里？
-You're going with Crawford.
-Where?

350
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:57,852
在西维吉尼亚
发现了一名女子尸体
Found a girl's body
in West Virginia.

351
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,756
她在水里一周了
看来是水牛比尔做的
Been in the water a week.
Looks like Buffalo Bill.

352
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:06,067
（西维吉尼亚州克莱县）

353
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,936
（联邦调查局）

354
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:15,867
让她们活上三天
我们不明白原因
Keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

355
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:19,172
死前没有强奸或虐待的迹象
No evidence of rape or
physical abuse prior to death.

356
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:21,872
这些伤口都是死后造成的
All the mutilation you see
there is postmortem.

357
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:24,608
三天...
Okay, three days...

358
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,051
然后他开枪射死她们
剥皮和弃尸
...then he shoots them, skins them
and dumps them.

359
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:29,951
每个尸体弃置在不同的河上
Each body in a different river.

360
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:33,286
河水冲走了证据
The water leaves us no trace
evidence of any kind.

361
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,929
那是第一个，费迪嘉拜姆
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

362
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:38,998
她的尸体是唯一被他沉下去的
Her body was the only one he
weighted down.

363
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:42,034
实际上，她是第三个被发现的
So actually, she was
the third girl found.

364
00:36:42,237 --> 00:36:44,467
继她之后，他变得懒惰了
After her, he got lazy.

365
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:49,038
好的，我们看看
Okay, let's see.

366
00:36:49,244 --> 00:36:53,442
圆圈是那些女子被掳走的位置
箭嘴是尸体被发现的地点
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.

367
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:58,711
今天这个被冲到这里来
在西维吉尼亚州埃尔克河被发现
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.

368
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,104
史达琳，仔细看看
告诉我你有什么发现
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

369
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,777
他是个白种男人
Well, he's a white male.

370
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:26,948
连环杀手倾向于
在自己的族群中猎杀
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

371
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:32,083
他不是个流浪者
他有自己的独立房子
He's not a drifter. He's got his
own house, not an apartment.

372
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:35,954
-为什么？
-他下毒手时，需要私人地方
-Why?
-What he does with them takes privacy.

373
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:40,595
他年约三、四十岁，孔武有力
He's in his 30s or 40s.
He's got real physical strength.

374
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:46,132
还有中年人的自制能力
谨慎而准绳
Combined with an older man's
self-control. He's cautious, precise.

375
00:37:46,835 --> 00:37:49,429
他从来不冲动，也不会罢休
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

376
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:52,805
为什么？
Why not?

377
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:56,434
他已经迷上了这回事
而且越来越熟练
He's got a real taste for it now,
and he's getting better at his work.

378
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,942
不错呢，有问题吗？
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

379
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,947
有的
Yes, sir.

380
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:06,915
你没有提及我报告里的任何资料
You haven't mentioned anything about
the information in my report...

381
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,518
或者莱达医生的提议
...or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

382
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,518
我正在考虑中
l'm considering it.

383
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:13,658
所以你派我去病院
That's why you sent me
in there, isn't it?

384
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,918
找他协助缉捕水牛比尔？
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

385
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,693
如果那是事实...
Well, if that was the case, then...

386
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:24,665
我希望可以早点知道罢了
...l just wish l was in on it,
that's all.

387
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,966
若以真正目的派你去
莱达会识破的
lf l'd sent you in there with a real
agenda, Lecter would have known it.

388
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:32,804
他会把你玩弄，什么也不会说
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

389
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:49,956
（格里殡仪馆）

390
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,142
打扰了，柏金斯警长？
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins?

391
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:09,609
这些是联邦调查局人员
These are the FBl people.

392
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:14,878
柏金斯警长，我是杰克克劳福
这是泰瑞和史达琳
Sheriff Perkins, Jack Crawford, FBl.
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

393
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:17,749
感谢邀请我们来到你们的管辖区
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

394
00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:21,188
是州政府检察部找你们的
Somebody from the state attorney's
office called you.

395
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,453
我们会通力合作，但现在...
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now--

396
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:24,924
警长
Sheriff...

397
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:30,397
我认为该在私底下
谈论这类性罪行的细节
...this type of sex crime has aspects
l'd just as soon discuss in private.

398
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:32,195
你明白吧？
Know what l mean?

399
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:25,482
奥加，去教堂叫区医生来
Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin
from the chapel.

400
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:26,708
我们在后面这里
We're back here.

401
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:30,082
叫拉玛弹奏完毕后过来
Tell Lamar to come on when
he's finished playing his music.

402
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:32,756
是的，我们稍后会传过来
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

403
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,860
行了
lt's working.

404
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:39,360
我要组成六线联系
芝加哥、底特律...
l need a six-way link up.
Chicago, Detroit--

405
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:40,964
什么？...
What? What?

406
00:41:45,905 --> 00:41:47,600
对不起
Excuse me.

407
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:51,071
对不起，各位警官先生，听着
Excuse me, officers and gentlemen.
Listen here, now.

408
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:53,472
我们要替她做一些事情
There's things we need to do
for her.

409
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,206
你们把她带来了这里
她的家人会感谢...
Y'all brought her this far, and her
folks would thank you if they could...

410
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:00,010
你们的善意和体谅
...for your kindness
and your sensitivity.

411
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:02,949
请离开吧，让我们照顾她好了
Please, go on now,
and let us take care of her.

412
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:05,215
走吧
Go on, now.

413
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,495
谢谢
Thank you.

414
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:14,929
谢谢
Thank you.

415
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:17,966
很好
Okay, good.

416
00:42:26,312 --> 00:42:30,976
是的，埃尔克河，准备传送
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.
Stand by for transmission.

417
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,087
瑞
Ray.

418
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:51,331
大家来看看她吧
Doctor, Lamar.
Let's take a look at her.

419
00:43:08,487 --> 00:43:09,545
天啊
Jesus....

420
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:18,020
史达琳，行了
Okay, Starling.

421
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:45,521
胸骨上有星形的伤口
Star-shaped contact entrance
wound over the sternum.

422
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,324
上面有个枪口印记
A muzzle stamp at the top.

423
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:52,622
-死于非命
-死于非命
-Wrongful death.
-Wrongful death.

424
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:56,164
她要被送去克拉斯顿的
病理学家那里
She'll have to go to the state
pathologist's at Claxton.

425
00:43:56,368 --> 00:43:58,461
我还是回去那个丧礼了
Well, l better get back
to that service.

426
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:00,002
利玛会帮你们的
Lamar will help you.

427
00:44:00,773 --> 00:44:02,866
老天爷
Lord Almighty.

428
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:08,838
你还观察到什么？
What else do you see, Starling?

429
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:13,451
她不是当地人
Well, she's not local.

430
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:16,485
她穿了三个耳洞，还有...
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's...

431
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,925
闪亮的指甲油，看来是城市人
...glitter nail polish.
lt looks like town to me.

432
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:30,163
她有两只指甲断了
Two of her fingernails
are broken off...

433
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:32,666
指甲下有泥土和沙粒
...and there's dirt or grit
under them.

434
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,930
她好像想爬过一些什么似的
lt looks like she's tried to claw her
way through something.

435
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,170
瑞，替她的牙齿拍照
稍后传真到失踪人口组
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them to Missing Persons.

436
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:40,605
好的
Right.

437
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,585
再拍一张
Let's do another.

438
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,357
她喉咙里有东西
She's got something in her throat.

439
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,827
当尸体被捞出水面时
When a body comes out
of the water...

440
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,699
口里总会有些树叶之类的东西
...lots of times there's
leaves and things in the mouth.

441
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,298
那是什么？
What is that?

442
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,097
豆荚吗？
Some kind of seedpod?

443
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,174
不，是一只虫茧
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

444
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:49,371
没可能自己走进去的
There's no way that could get
way down in there.

445
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,310
除非有人把它塞进去
Not unless somebody
shoved it in there.

446
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,914
我们把她翻过来会较易采指纹
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her.

447
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,452
帮帮我
Lamar, give me a hand?

448
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,146
好的
Yes, sir, l will.

449
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:08,295
你看这些是什么？
Oh, Jack.
What do you make of these?

450
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:11,662
跟其他死者的形状不同
拍几张大特写
Different configuration than
the other victims. Get close-ups.

451
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,461
死者的皮肤...
Victim's skin removed...

452
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:16,765
在臀部以上
有两块菱形的皮肤被剥去
...in two diamond-shaped sections
above the buttocks.

453
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,171
伤口跟第二或第三节脊骨平衡
Exit wound level with the second
or third thoracic vertebrae...

454
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:23,245
距离右肩胛骨大约六英寸
...approximately six inches from
the right shoulder blade.

455
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,846
史达琳
Starling...

456
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,442
我对那个警长说
我们不该在女人面前谈
...when l told that sheriff we
shouldn't talk in front of a woman...

457
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,246
那令你很气恼吧？
...that burned you, didn't it?

458
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,913
那只是个烟幕，我要打发他走
lt was just smoke, Starling.
l had to get rid of him.

459
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,923
是很要紧
lt matters, Mr. Crawford.

460
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,255
探员们想看你怎样应付
Cops look at you to see how to act.

461
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,930
很要紧的
lt matters.

462
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,462
我明白了
Point taken.

463
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,669
手腕周围有被捆绑的痕迹
Ligature marks found around wrists...

464
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,536
足踝就没有
...not around the ankles.

465
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,576
显示死后才剥皮的
This would indicate that
the skinning was postmortem.

466
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,495
时间到了，轮到我
Time, Pilch. My move.

467
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:25,608
-不公平，你用食物引诱它
-真无赖，仍然是轮到我
-No fair! You lured him with produce.
-Tough noogies. lt's still my turn.

468
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,011
宝贝，慢慢来
Nice and slow, baby.

469
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,711
若那只甲虫推动你的棋子
也算数吗？
lf the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

470
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,512
当然算数，你怎么玩的？
Of course it counts. How do you play?

471
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,315
史达琳探员？
Agent Starling?

472
00:47:39,757 --> 00:47:41,452
这东西从哪里来的？
Where the heck did this come from?

473
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,418
它粘糊糊的
lt's practically mush.

474
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:47,859
在一个被杀死者身上找到的
尸体在埃尔克河里
lt was found in a murder victim.
The body was in the Elk River.

475
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,532
是水牛比尔干的吗？
lt's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

476
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,065
我不能透露
l can't tell you any more.

477
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:52,462
我们在电台听到
We heard it on the radio.

478
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,969
这是一宗真实谋杀案的线索？
酷
You mean this is a clue
from a real murder case? Cool!

479
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,801
别管他，他是无名小卒
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

480
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,940
小角天蛾，可能是...
Sphingid Ceratomia, maybe--

481
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:04,774
它是只大吸血鬼
Boy, he's a big sucker.

482
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,880
好吧
Okay...

483
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,052
查看一下，形态学
...let's check morphology.

484
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,624
史达琳探员
你不查案时会做什么？
What do you do when you're not
detecting, Agent Starling?

485
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,457
做个学生
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

486
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,562
你去过吃起司汉堡和喝啤酒吗？
You ever go out for
cheeseburgers and beer?

487
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:30,637
那有趣的招牌酒？
The amusing house wine?

488
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,672
博士，你是否对我有意？
Are you hitting on me, doctor?

489
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,376
-是的
-找到了！
-Yes.
-Gotcha!

490
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,443
你找到什么？
What do you got?

491
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:41,516
史达琳探员，这个是阴间冥河
Agent Starling,
meet Mr. Acherontia Styx.

492
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:42,811
真奇怪
Weird.

493
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,217
认识它的人多叫它做骷髅飞蛾
Better known to his friends
as the Death's-head moth.

494
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,583
它从哪里来的？
Where does it come from?

495
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,727
这正是古怪之处
它们只活在亚洲
That's what's strange.
They only live in Asia.

496
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,556
它们是从进口的卵子繁殖的
They're specially raised from
imported eggs.

497
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,131
有人饲养这只东西
喂它吃蜜糖和茄类植物
Somebody grew this guy.
Fed him honey and nightshade.

498
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,131
给它保暖
Kept him warm.

499
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:01,701
有人很爱护它
Somebody loved him.

500
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,637
你在哪里？
Where are you?!

501
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,142
放我出去！
Let me out of here!

502
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:48,412
喂！
Hey!

503
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,053
救我！
Please help me!

504
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,919
求你救我
Help me, please!

505
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,652
干嘛你不答我？求求你！
Why won't you answer me?! Please!

506
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:05,864
-各位早，我是唐娜佛鲁兹
-我是报导体育的金凯素
-Good morning. l'm Donna Ferucchi.
-l'm Gene Cassel with sports.

507
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,062
我是提姆兰汉
今早的头条新闻如下
And l'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story this morning:

508
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:13,672
马丁参议员的
25岁女儿凯瑟琳马丁...
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin...

509
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,209
一度被列为失踪人士
...listed as a missing person...

510
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:19,906
相信她已经
被称为“水牛比尔”的杀手绑架
...is believed to have been kidnapped
by the killer known as ''Buffalo Bill.''

511
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:23,553
孟斐斯市警方说
已确认出该名失踪女孩的衬衫
Memphis police say the missing girl's
blouse has been identified...

512
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:28,316
它后面被割破，案情耐人寻味
...sliced up the back, in what has
become a kind of grim calling card.

513
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,461
凯瑟琳是
田纳西州的共和党...
Young Catherine is the only daughter
of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin...

514
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:34,688
马丁参议员的独生女
...the Republican senator
from Tennessee.

515
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:38,528
虽然这宗绑架案没有政治动机
And while her kidnapping is not
considered politically motivated...

516
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,671
但政府高层仍然相当重视
...it has stirred the government
to its highest levels.

517
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,670
正在佛蒙特州滑雪的总统
Reached for comment on the ski
slopes of Vermont...

518
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,436
接受访问时表示
“极度关注”事件
...the president himself said to be,
and l quote, ''intensely concerned.''

519
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:53,242
马丁参议员于较早前
录影了以下的呼吁
Just moments ago, Senator Martin
taped this dramatic personal plea:

520
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,250
我向挟持小女的人说话
l'm speaking, now, to the person
holding my daughter.

521
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,791
凯瑟琳是非常温文和善良的
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

522
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,524
你跟她谈谈就知道
Talk to her and you'll see.

523
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,764
你有力量，你有控制权
You have the power.
You are in charge.

524
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,804
我知道你感受到爱和善心的
l know you can feel love
and compassion.

525
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:20,873
你有一个向全世界
展示的大好机会...
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world...

526
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,536
就是你是善良而坚强的
...that you can be merciful,
as well as strong.

527
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,512
你有能力善待凯瑟琳...
That you're big enough
to treat Catherine better...

528
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,879
比这个世界待你更好
...than the world has treated you.

529
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,055
你有那个能力
You have that power.

530
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:36,549
求你，我的女儿是凯瑟琳
Please. My daughter is Catherine.

531
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,819
真是聪明
Boy, that's smart.

532
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,496
真的很聪明
Jesus, that's really smart.

533
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,698
她不断重复那个名字
She keeps repeating the name.

534
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:47,461
若他视凯瑟琳为一个人而非物件
就难以下毒手
lf he sees Catherine as a person, not
an object, it's harder to tear her up.

535
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:51,402
求你放了我的女儿
Please, release my little girl.

536
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:55,236
史达琳小姐
你来我的医院干什么？
What you're doing, Ms. Starling,
is coming into my hospital...

537
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:59,006
并第三次拒绝跟我分享资料
...and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

538
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:03,810
这不过是赖普案的例行后续
Sir, l told you this is just
a routine follow-up on the Raspail--

539
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,113
他是我的病人，我有知情权
He is my patient. l have rights.

540
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:07,153
我明白
l understand that.

541
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:11,851
史达琳小姐，我不是个笨蛋
Look, l am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

542
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,193
这是检察官的电话号码
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney.

543
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:19,698
请你跟他谈
或者让我执行任务，明白吗？
Please, either discuss it with him
or let me do my job, you understand?

544
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:28,371
如果你的分析
能帮助我们抓到水牛比尔...
lf your profile helps us catch
Buffalo Bill...

545
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:31,206
及时救出凯瑟琳马丁...
...in time to save Catherine Martin...

546
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:34,906
参议员答应把你转送到...
...the senator promises you
a transfer to the VA Hospital...

547
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:38,554
它位于纽约奥尼达公园
可看到附近的园林景色的医院
...at Oneida Park, New York,
with a view of the woods nearby.

548
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,485
当然仍是高度设防的
Maximum security still applies,
of course.

549
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:44,451
你可以阅读书籍
You'd have reasonable access to books.

550
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,420
最好的是...
Best of all, though...

551
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:51,657
你每年可以离开医院一周
...one week of the year, you get
to leave the hospital...

552
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,200
去这里
...and go here:

553
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,707
普拉姆岛
Plum lsland.

554
00:52:59,642 --> 00:53:02,839
在那一星期里
你都可以在沙滩漫步
Every day of that week,
you may walk on the beach.

555
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:06,243
也可以在海中畅泳一小时
You may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour...

556
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:09,077
当然是受特种部队的监视
...under SWAT team surveillance,
of course.

557
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,413
给你的
And there you have it.

558
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:18,422
水牛比尔的档案副本
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

559
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,830
参议员的建议书副本
A copy of the senator's offer.

560
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,297
这个建议是无商讨余地的
This offer is non-negotiable
and final.

561
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,527
凯瑟琳马丁死了你就一无所得
Catherine Martin dies,
you get nothing.

562
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:43,478
普拉姆岛动物病症研究中心
Plum lsland Animal Disease
Research Center.

563
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:46,712
听来很吸引
Sounds charming.

564
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:51,153
那个岛有一流的海滩
That's only part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.

565
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,591
岛上有燕鸥巢，有漂亮的...
Terns nest there.
There's beautiful--

566
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,924
燕鸥？
Terns?

567
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,960
如果我帮你
也会是我们的转机
lf l help you, Clarice, it will be
''turns'' with us too.

568
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,264
我们互相交换资料吧
Quid pro quo. l tell you things,
you tell me things.

569
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,135
但不是关于这宗案件
是关于你自己
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

570
00:54:06,342 --> 00:54:09,311
交换，好不好？
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

571
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:15,340
好不好，克丽丝？
可怜的凯瑟琳在等着
Yes or no, Clarice? Poor little
Catherine is waiting.

572
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,952
好吧
Go, doctor.

573
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,749
你最糟的童年记忆是什么？
What is your worst memory
of childhood?

574
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:25,387
家父去世
The death of my father.

575
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:29,322
告诉我，别说谎，我会知道的
Tell me about it.
And don't lie, or l'll know.

576
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,527
他是镇上的警长
He was a town marshal...

577
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:39,104
有一晚他遇上两个
从药房走出来的窃匪
...and one night he surprised two
burglars coming out of a drugstore.

578
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,310
他们向他开枪
They shot him.

579
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,141
他当场死亡？
Was he killed outright?

580
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:49,944
不是，他很坚强
熬了个几个月
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

581
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,088
我母亲在我年幼时去世
My mother died when l was
very young, so...

582
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:58,252
自始父亲就成为我的一切
...my father had become
the whole world to me...

583
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,828
他离开后，我一无所有
我那时十岁
...and when he left me, l had
nothing. l was 1 0 years old.

584
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:05,227
你很坦白
You're very frank, Clarice.

585
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:10,301
我相信私底下结识你
会很有意思的
l think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

586
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:14,073
交换资料
Quid pro quo, doctor.

587
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:19,673
谈谈西维州小姐吧
她是否身材肥大？
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

588
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,282
是的
Yes.

589
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,886
大屁股，肉团团？
Big through the hips, roomy?

590
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,386
死者们全都是
They all were.

591
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:29,284
还有什么线索？
What else?

592
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:33,292
她的喉咙被异物塞住
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

593
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:38,024
还没有正式公布的
我们不知道它有何意思
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

594
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,861
一只蝴蝶？
Was it a butterfly?

595
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,899
是的，一只飞蛾
Yes. A moth.

596
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:49,240
一小时前，我们在
班哲文赖普的头颅内也找到
Just like the one we found in
Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

597
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,044
为何他把它们放进去？
Why does he place them there,
doctor?

598
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:56,676
飞蛾的特点是转变
The significance of the moth
is change.

599
00:55:56,886 --> 00:56:00,788
幼虫变成蝶蛹或者蛹
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa...

600
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,652
再变成美丽的蝴蝶
...and from thence into beauty.

601
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,795
比尔也想转变
Our Billy wants to change too.

602
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:10,692
变性癖和暴力之间是没有关连的
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence.

603
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,698
-变性癖者是很被动的
-很聪明
-Transsexuals are very passive.
-Clever girl.

604
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,635
你有捉拿到他的本领，知道吗？
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

605
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,808
不知道，为什么？
No. Tell me why.

606
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,376
你父亲被杀后你成了孤儿
后来怎么样？
After your father's murder you were
orphaned. What happened next?

607
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:32,448
答案并非在那双廉价鞋子上
l don't imagine the answer is on
those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

608
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:36,557
我去了蒙大拿州
跟我母亲的表妹夫妇同住
l went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

609
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:38,056
他们有一个牧场
They had a ranch.

610
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,060
牧牛场？
Was it a cattle ranch?

611
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,158
牧羊和马
Sheep and horses.

612
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:43,962
你在那里住了多久？
How long did you live there?

613
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,100
两个月
Two months.

614
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:47,728
为何时间这么短？
Why so briefly?

615
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:49,396
我跑掉了
l ran away.

616
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,774
为什么？牧场主人逼你口交？
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

617
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,945
他有没有鸡奸你？
Did he sodomize you?

618
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,174
没有，他是个很正派的人
No. He was a very decent man.

619
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:04,113
交换资料
Quid pro quo, doctor.

620
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,754
比尔不是个真正的变性癖者
Billy is not a real transsexual.

621
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,857
但他以为自己是，他想那样
But he thinks he is.
He tries to be.

622
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,926
我相信他想做很多东西
He's tried to be a lot of
things, l expect.

623
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:17,122
你说我有捉拿他的本领
是什么意思？
You said l was very close to the way
we'd catch him. What did you mean?

624
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,029
有三间主要做变性手术的中心
There are three major centers for
transsexual surgery:

625
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:24,332
约翰霍金斯、明尼苏达州大学
和哥伦布医疗中心
Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

626
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,839
若比尔向它们申请做变性手术
而又被拒绝...
l wouldn't be surprised if Billy
applied for sex reassignment...

627
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:31,810
我也不会感到惊
...at one or all of them,
and been rejected.

628
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,778
他们根据什么来拒绝他？
On what basis would they reject him?

629
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:39,311
试找寻跟暴力有关的童年创伤吧
Look for severe childhood
disturbances associated with violence.

630
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,423
比尔并非天生是个罪犯
Our Billy wasn't born
a criminal, Clarice...

631
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,618
是经过多年来惯常的
虐待所导致的
...he was made one through
years of systematic abuse.

632
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:50,265
他讨厌自己的身分
Billy hates his own identity,
you see...

633
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:53,230
他以为那是令他
成为变性癖者的原因
...and he thinks that makes him
a transsexual...

634
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:57,566
但他的病征要更凶残...
...but his pathology is
a thousand times more savage...

635
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,571
和可怕千倍
...and more terrifying.

636
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:07,076
它涂润肤液在身上
它听到指示总会依着做
lt rubs the lotion on its skin.
lt does this whenever it's told.

637
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:09,345
先生，我的家人会付钱的
Mister, my family will pay cash.

638
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:12,679
无论你要多少赎金，他们都会付
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.

639
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:18,358
它涂润肤液在身上
否则又要挨打了
lt rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again.

640
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:22,429
是的，珍宝，她会挨打的
Yes, she will, Precious.
She'll get the hose.

641
00:58:23,498 --> 00:58:26,262
好吧...
Okay, okay, okay.

642
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:29,133
我做吧
Okay, l'll do it.

643
00:58:29,337 --> 00:58:30,804
好的
Okay.

644
00:58:31,973 --> 00:58:37,309
先生，如果你放我走
我答应不会起诉你
Mister, if you let me go,
l won't press charges. l promise.

645
00:58:38,313 --> 00:58:40,804
我妈是个重要人物
See, my mom is a real important woman.

646
00:58:41,015 --> 00:58:43,006
相信你也知道吧
l guess you already know that.

647
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:46,210
它把润肤液放在篮里
Now it places the lotion
in the basket.

648
00:58:46,654 --> 00:58:47,678
求求你！
Please!

649
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:50,649
求求你，我想回家
Please, l want to go home.

650
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:54,553
我想回家！求求你！放我吧
l want to go home!
Please! Please let me.

651
00:58:54,762 --> 00:58:57,196
把润肤液放在篮里
lt places the lotion in the basket.

652
00:58:58,066 --> 00:59:02,196
我想见我妈妈，求你放我吧
l want to see my mommy.
Please let me.

653
00:59:02,937 --> 00:59:06,703
我想再见到我妈妈，我想...
l want to see my mom again.
l want--

654
00:59:06,908 --> 00:59:09,399
我想见我妈妈
l want to see my mom.

655
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:12,645
把那他妈的润肤液放在篮里！
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

656
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:52,508
你仍然以为可在沙滩漫步
和看鸟儿吗？
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

657
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,483
不会了
l don't think so.

658
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:57,751
我找过凯瑟琳马丁参议员
l called Senator Ruth Martin.

659
00:59:57,959 --> 01:00:00,723
她没听过跟你有任何协议
She never heard of any deal with you.

660
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:04,123
他们骗你
They scammed you, Hannibal.

661
01:00:05,566 --> 01:00:07,124
出去
Stand outside.

662
01:00:08,503 --> 01:00:10,095
把门关上
And shut the door.

663
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:11,702
巴尼
Barney.

664
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:22,078
从没有跟马丁参议员作过协议
但现在有了
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

665
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:23,511
是我议定的
l designed it.

666
01:00:23,718 --> 01:00:27,484
当然，我也为自己的利益
定下了一些条件
Of course, l worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well.

667
01:00:27,689 --> 01:00:30,749
说出水牛比尔的名字
ldentify Buffalo Bill by name...

668
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:33,017
如果那个女孩及时被发现
...and if the girl is found in time...

669
01:00:33,227 --> 01:00:37,493
你就会被转送到田纳西州的
丛树山州立监狱
...you'll be transferred to Brushy
Mountain State Prison in Tennessee.

670
01:00:38,566 --> 01:00:40,431
回答我
Answer me, Hannibal.

671
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:43,995
你现在回答我
You answer me now...

672
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:47,072
否则，天啊
你休想离开这个牢房
...or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

673
01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:51,273
水牛比尔是谁？
Who is Buffalo Bill?

674
01:00:52,146 --> 01:00:54,307
他的名字是路易斯
His first name is Louis.

675
01:00:54,749 --> 01:00:58,310
其余的我只会在田纳西州
亲自对参议员说
l'll tell the rest to the Senator
herself, but only in Tennessee.

676
01:00:58,519 --> 01:01:00,987
我也有几个条件
And l have a few conditions of my own.

677
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:05,684
替他梳洗一下，准备出发
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

678
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:09,925
杰克，汉内堡莱达正被转送往
孟斐斯途中
Jack, Hannibal Lecter
is being transferred to Memphis.

679
01:01:10,164 --> 01:01:11,392
转送？
Transferred?

680
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,093
你可有个见习生，冒参议员之名
向莱达提出一个虚假的建议？
Did you have a trainee make a phony
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

681
01:01:16,304 --> 01:01:18,135
是我的主意，我逼不得已
l rolled the dice. l had to.

682
01:01:18,339 --> 01:01:20,364
她气疯了
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

683
01:01:20,575 --> 01:01:22,509
司法部的保罗肯度拿来了
Paul Krendler's here from Justice.

684
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,543
她要求他在孟斐斯接手
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis.

685
01:01:32,086 --> 01:01:35,920
（孟斐斯市国际机场）

686
01:01:50,138 --> 01:01:52,003
莱达医生，欢迎到孟斐斯
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

687
01:01:52,206 --> 01:01:54,834
我是鲍尔探员
这位是派屈克警长
l'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

688
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:57,135
我们会像你待我们那么好的
We'll treat you as good
as you treat us.

689
01:01:57,345 --> 01:02:00,439
你乖乖的，就会得到舒服的待遇
You be a gentleman,
you'll get three hots and a cot.

690
01:02:01,482 --> 01:02:05,350
长官，请在这里签名
我们作合法的移交
Sir, if you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

691
01:02:10,691 --> 01:02:12,386
用我的吧
Here, sir, use mine.

692
01:02:59,574 --> 01:03:00,563
马丁参议员
Senator Martin...

693
01:03:01,909 --> 01:03:04,036
汉内堡莱达医生
...Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

694
01:03:08,783 --> 01:03:10,375
莱达医生
Dr. Lecter...

695
01:03:10,852 --> 01:03:14,310
我带了一份宣誓书
保证你新的权利
...l've brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

696
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:17,080
在我签署前你要看看的
You'll want to read it before l sign.

697
01:03:20,728 --> 01:03:24,960
我不会为了小利益
而耽误你或凯瑟琳的时间
l won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges.

698
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:29,068
克丽丝史达琳和克劳福
已经浪费了太多时间
Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford
have wasted too much time already.

699
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:32,596
但愿他们没有害死
那个可怜的女孩
l only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.

700
01:03:33,674 --> 01:03:36,939
让我帮你吧，事成后我会信任你
Let me help you now.
l will trust you when it is all over.

701
01:03:37,411 --> 01:03:39,436
我答应你，保罗
You have my word. Paul.

702
01:03:42,183 --> 01:03:44,651
水牛比尔的真名是路易斯法兰
Buffalo Bill's real name
is Louis Friend.

703
01:03:45,987 --> 01:03:49,946
我只见过他一次
1980年4、5月间由我的病人...
l met him just once. He was referred
to me in April or May, 1 980...

704
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:52,819
班哲文赖普转介给我的
...by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

705
01:03:53,027 --> 01:03:54,961
他们是爱人
They were lovers, you see.

706
01:03:55,329 --> 01:03:59,288
但赖普变得很害怕
But Raspail had become
very frightened.

707
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,936
看来路易斯谋杀了一个流浪汉
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient...

708
01:04:03,137 --> 01:04:04,871
用他的皮肤做了一些东西
...and done things with the skin.

709
01:04:04,871 --> 01:04:06,702
用他的皮肤做了一些东西
...and done things with the skin.

710
01:04:07,607 --> 01:04:10,098
我们要他的地址和容貌特征
We need his address
and a physical description.

711
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,241
告诉我，参议员...
Tell me, senator.

712
01:04:13,713 --> 01:04:16,147
你有没有亲自哺育凯瑟琳？
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

713
01:04:16,582 --> 01:04:19,210
-什么？
-你有没有给她喂奶？
-What?
-Did you breast-feed her?

714
01:04:19,418 --> 01:04:21,784
-混帐
-我有的
-Now, wait a minute!
-Yes. l did.

715
01:04:22,088 --> 01:04:24,181
令你的乳头变得坚挺，是吗？
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

716
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:25,379
你这个混蛋！
You son of a bitch!

717
01:04:25,892 --> 01:04:29,692
把人的腿切除
他仍感到振奋
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

718
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:33,169
告诉我，妈妈
当你的小女儿被杀时
Tell me, Mom, when your
little girl is on the slab...

719
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:34,840
你哪里会感到振奋？
...where will it tickle you?

720
01:04:35,776 --> 01:04:39,109
把这个畜生带回巴尔的摩
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

721
01:04:40,113 --> 01:04:43,082
五英尺十英寸、身材魁悟
约一百八十磅
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 1 80 pounds.

722
01:04:43,283 --> 01:04:45,843
金发、浅蓝色眼睛
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

723
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:47,281
他现在大约三十五岁
He'd be about 35 now.

724
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:50,388
他声称住在费城，可能是说谎
He said he lived in Philadelphia
but may have lied.

725
01:04:50,591 --> 01:04:52,320
我只记得这么多了，妈
That's all l can remember, Mom.

726
01:04:52,526 --> 01:04:55,188
若我再想起什么，我会通知你的
But if l think of any more,
l will let you know.

727
01:04:57,664 --> 01:05:00,098
参议员，还有一件事
Oh, and senator, just one more thing:

728
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:04,266
你的套装很漂亮
Love your suit.

729
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:09,375
与马丁参议员
在今天较早前的会面中
ln a meeting earlier today
with Senator Ruth Martin...

730
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:13,808
莱达医生同意协助追缉水牛比尔
...Dr. Lecter agreed to help in the
investigation to find Buffalo Bill.

731
01:05:14,014 --> 01:05:15,413
（谢尔比县法院大楼）

732
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:18,184
-你扮演什么角色？
-我对莱达医生的...
-How do you fit in?
-My unique insight...

733
01:05:18,385 --> 01:05:20,319
独特触觉促成了这次突破
...into Lecter made the breakthrough.

734
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,578
水牛比尔叫什么名字？
Buffalo Bill's name?

735
01:05:21,788 --> 01:05:25,554
这是目前有关当局的秘密
His name is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities.

736
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,227
-可否给我们...
-我是奇顿医生
-Can you give us--?
-l'm Dr. Frederick Chilton.

737
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:29,986
-怎样写法？
-奇特的奇...
-Spell it?
-That's C-H--

738
01:05:31,665 --> 01:05:33,656
你是奇顿医生的组员吗？
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

739
01:05:33,867 --> 01:05:36,358
我刚在外面见到他
Well, l just saw him outside, sir.

740
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:39,835
不能有太多人接近莱达
我们接到死亡恐吓
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've received death threats.

741
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,632
我明白的
l understand, sir.

742
01:05:47,748 --> 01:05:49,375
登记和把武器放下
Log in and check your weapon.

743
01:05:50,817 --> 01:05:53,047
我不能独自邀功的
l can't take all the credit myself.

744
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:55,551
马丁参议员、司法部、联邦调查局
Senator Martin,
Justice Department, FBl...

745
01:05:55,756 --> 01:05:59,192
巴尔的摩州立医院的人员
最困难就是...
...folks at the Baltimore State
Hospital. Now for the hard part:

746
01:05:59,393 --> 01:06:01,190
逮捕那个疑匪
Apprehending the suspect.

747
01:06:01,695 --> 01:06:03,754
对不起，我要赶飞机了
Excuse me, l have to catch a flight.

748
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:10,196
指挥台，我是杰各警员
Command desk, Officer Jacobs.

749
01:06:16,076 --> 01:06:17,566
（路易斯法兰飞禽、猥亵）

750
01:06:17,778 --> 01:06:18,938
（铁）

751
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:22,206
-他们说的是事实吗？
-什么？
-ls it true what they're saying?
-Huh?

752
01:06:23,216 --> 01:06:25,241
他是个吸血尸？
He's some kind of vampire?

753
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:29,716
他们没有替他取名
They don't have a name for what he is.

754
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:32,519
小姐，你知道规矩的吧？
You do know the rules, ma'am?

755
01:06:33,226 --> 01:06:35,558
知道，我以前盘问过他
Yes, l've questioned him before.

756
01:06:39,066 --> 01:06:40,055
去吧
Go ahead.

757
01:07:17,571 --> 01:07:19,539
克丽丝，晚安
Good evening, Clarice.

758
01:07:21,108 --> 01:07:23,804
你可能想要回你的画吧
l thought you might like
your drawings back.

759
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,471
直到你有自己的景观
Just until you get your view.

760
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:31,446
真是周到
How very thoughtful.

761
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:35,184
还是在你们破案前
克劳福派你来...
Or did Jack Crawford
send you for one last wheedle...

762
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:37,619
说最后一次的花言巧语？
...before you're both
booted off the case?

763
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:40,320
不，是我自己想来的
No. l came because l wanted to.

764
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:47,432
人家会说我们在恋爱呢
People will say we're in love.

765
01:07:51,571 --> 01:07:54,062
安克斯岛
Anthrax lsland.

766
01:07:54,274 --> 01:07:57,243
真是有心思，克丽丝
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

767
01:07:57,444 --> 01:07:58,433
你画的？
Yours?

768
01:07:59,146 --> 01:08:00,170
是
Yes.

769
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,938
对
Yeah.

770
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:04,379
很好
That was good.

771
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:06,518
但我同情可怜的凯瑟琳
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

772
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,745
滴答...
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

773
01:08:08,955 --> 01:08:11,753
你的字谜有破绽了
Your anagrams are showing, doctor.

774
01:08:12,592 --> 01:08:14,116
路易斯法兰？
Louis Friend?

775
01:08:14,828 --> 01:08:18,025
是硫化铁，也叫做黄铜铁
lron sulfide,
also known as fool's gold.

776
01:08:18,465 --> 01:08:22,367
克丽丝，你的毛病是
你要活得轻松一点
Oh, Clarice, your problem is, you
need to get more fun out of life.

777
01:08:22,836 --> 01:08:25,805
你在巴尔的摩时说了真话
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

778
01:08:26,006 --> 01:08:27,473
现在继续吧
Please continue now.

779
01:08:28,075 --> 01:08:30,566
我看过那些档案了，你看过吗？
Well, l've read the case files.
Have you?

780
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:34,004
你要缉拿他的资料都在里面
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages.

781
01:08:34,214 --> 01:08:37,115
-那么教我怎样做
-首要的原则
-Then tell me how.
-First principles, Clarice.

782
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:40,411
是简易，读马可奥勒利乌斯吧
Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius.

783
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:44,078
凡事都问：它是什么？
Of each particular thing, ask:
What is it in itself?

784
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:46,088
它有什么本质？
What is its nature?

785
01:08:46,526 --> 01:08:50,428
你寻找的这个人，他做什么？
What does he do, this man you seek?

786
01:08:51,932 --> 01:08:53,160
杀害女人
He kills women.

787
01:08:53,366 --> 01:08:56,335
不，那是次要的
No. That is incidental.

788
01:08:57,337 --> 01:09:02,434
他主要是做什么？
他杀人是为了满足什么？
What is the principle thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

789
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:04,204
愤怒
Anger...

790
01:09:05,846 --> 01:09:09,873
社会认同和性困惑
...social acceptance
and sexual frustration--

791
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:11,072
不是！
No!

792
01:09:11,651 --> 01:09:13,676
他贪图
He covets.

793
01:09:14,554 --> 01:09:16,112
那是他的本性
That is his nature.

794
01:09:16,623 --> 01:09:18,955
我们怎样才会开始贪图？
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

795
01:09:19,726 --> 01:09:22,354
我们是否去寻找贪图的东西？
Do we seek out things to covet?

796
01:09:22,963 --> 01:09:24,863
尝试回答吧
Make an effort to answer now.

797
01:09:25,065 --> 01:09:27,533
不是，我们只是...
No, we just--

798
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:31,067
我们看见日常的东西就开始贪图
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day.

799
01:09:31,271 --> 01:09:34,570
你可有感到一些眼睛在盯着你？
Don't you feel eyes moving
over your body, Clarice?

800
01:09:35,308 --> 01:09:38,709
你的眼睛
又可有寻找你要的东西？
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

801
01:09:39,412 --> 01:09:41,744
有的，请你告诉我吧
All right, yes.
Now, please tell me how.

802
01:09:41,948 --> 01:09:43,415
不
No.

803
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:46,119
轮到你告诉我了
lt is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

804
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,787
你再没有假期可哄骗我了
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

805
01:09:49,456 --> 01:09:51,947
为何你离开那个牧场？
Why did you leave that ranch?

806
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:56,286
我们没有时间再玩这一套了
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.

807
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:59,021
但我们的时间观念是不同的
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

808
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:01,097
你只有这么多的时间
This is all the time you'll have.

809
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:03,599
稍后吧，请听着
我们只有五个...
Later. Please listen.
We've only got five--

810
01:10:03,803 --> 01:10:09,276
不，我现在要听
No! l will listen now.

811
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:12,245
父亲被杀后，你十岁就成了孤儿
Your father's murder orphaned you
when you were 1 0.

812
01:10:12,445 --> 01:10:17,280
你去了蒙大拿，跟一些养羊马的
表亲同住，之后呢？
You went to live with cousins on a
sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And?

813
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:21,748
我在一个早上跑掉了
And one morning l just ran away.

814
01:10:22,522 --> 01:10:26,014
不是的，什么驱使你离开？
Not ''just,'' Clarice.
What set you off?

815
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,818
你在什么时候出发？
You started at what time?

816
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:29,859
很早，天还没亮
Early, still dark.

817
01:10:30,063 --> 01:10:32,657
有东西吵醒你，是不是一个梦？
Then something woke you.
Was it a dream?

818
01:10:32,866 --> 01:10:33,958
是什么？
What was it?

819
01:10:35,502 --> 01:10:37,265
我听到一种奇怪的声音
l heard a strange noise.

820
01:10:38,505 --> 01:10:39,870
是什么？
What was it?

821
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,702
是...
lt was...

822
01:10:42,909 --> 01:10:44,399
尖叫声
...screaming.

823
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:48,675
像小孩的尖叫声
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

824
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,716
你怎么做？
What did you do?

825
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:52,582
我下楼
l went...

826
01:10:52,786 --> 01:10:55,482
走出屋外
...downstairs. Outside.

827
01:10:57,624 --> 01:11:00,218
我偷进了壳仓
l crept up into the barn.

828
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:03,624
我很害怕看进去，但又必须看
l was so scared to look inside,
but l had to.

829
01:11:04,764 --> 01:11:08,063
你看见什么？克丽丝？
And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

830
01:11:09,502 --> 01:11:10,799
一些羔羊
Lambs.

831
01:11:12,005 --> 01:11:13,666
它们在尖叫
They were screaming.

832
01:11:14,241 --> 01:11:17,005
他们在宰杀那些羔羊？
They were slaughtering
the spring lambs?

833
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:19,273
而它们在尖叫
And they were screaming.

834
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:22,309
那你就跑掉了？
And you ran away?

835
01:11:22,515 --> 01:11:26,349
不是，最初我想释放它们
No. First l tried to free them.

836
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,454
我打开它们的闸门
l opened the gate to their pen.

837
01:11:29,656 --> 01:11:33,092
它们只是站在那里，很困惑的
不肯走
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

838
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:35,784
但你可以走，你也走了
是不是？
But you could and you did, didn't you?

839
01:11:36,596 --> 01:11:39,997
是的，我抱起一只羊就拔足逃跑
Yes. l took one lamb
and l ran away as fast as l could.

840
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,997
你去哪里？
Where were you going, Clarice?

841
01:11:42,202 --> 01:11:45,194
不知道，我没有食物和水
l don't know. l didn't have
any food, any water...

842
01:11:45,405 --> 01:11:48,033
而且当时很冷，非常冷
...and it was very cold.
lt was very cold.

843
01:11:50,243 --> 01:11:51,369
我以为...
l thought....

844
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:54,839
我以为，至少可救到一只羊
l thought if l could save just one...

845
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,442
但它很重
...but he was so heavy.

846
01:11:59,552 --> 01:12:01,042
真的很重
He was so heavy.

847
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:10,295
我走不了几哩路
警长的车就把我截住
l didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriffs car picked me up.

848
01:12:13,466 --> 01:12:17,664
牧场主人很生气
把我送到博斯曼的路德会孤儿院
The rancher was so angry he sent me
to a Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

849
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:20,496
我再没看过那个牧场了
l never saw the ranch again.

850
01:12:21,207 --> 01:12:23,937
你的羊又怎么样？
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

851
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:27,176
他们把它杀了
They killed him.

852
01:12:27,547 --> 01:12:29,742
有时你仍会惊醒，是吗？
You still wake up sometimes,
don't you?

853
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,745
在黑暗中醒来...
Wake up in the dark...

854
01:12:32,419 --> 01:12:35,252
听到那些羔羊的尖叫声？
...and hear the screaming
of the lambs?

855
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:36,947
是的
Yes.

856
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:41,256
你相信如果把凯瑟琳救了出来
And you think if you save
poor Catherine...

857
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:45,022
可以令它们停止尖叫是吗？
你相信如果凯瑟琳活着...
...you can make them stop, don't you?
You think if Catherine lives...

858
01:12:45,231 --> 01:12:48,428
你就不会在黑夜中...
...you won't wake up
in the dark ever again...

859
01:12:48,635 --> 01:12:51,502
再被那些可怖的羊声惊醒了
...to that awful screaming
of the lambs.

860
01:12:52,672 --> 01:12:54,037
我不知道
l don't know.

861
01:12:54,774 --> 01:12:56,105
我不知道
l don't know.

862
01:12:57,811 --> 01:13:00,211
谢谢你，克丽丝
Thank you, Clarice.

863
01:13:00,413 --> 01:13:01,971
谢谢你
Thank you.

864
01:13:02,282 --> 01:13:04,273
告诉我他的名字
Tell me his name, doctor.

865
01:13:11,224 --> 01:13:13,488
是奇顿医生吧
Dr. Chilton, l presume.

866
01:13:14,094 --> 01:13:15,652
我相信你们是认识的
l think you know each other.

867
01:13:17,897 --> 01:13:19,421
好吧
Okay.

868
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:22,193
-我们找到他了
-我们走吧
-We found her.
-Let's go.

869
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:24,165
医生，轮到你了
lt's your turn, doctor.

870
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:26,232
-出去
-说出他的名字
-Out!
-Tell me his name.

871
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:29,272
抱歉，我接到命令
要把你送上飞机
Sorry, ma'am, l've got orders
to put you on a plane.

872
01:13:29,476 --> 01:13:30,636
走吧
Come on, now.

873
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,878
勇敢的克丽丝
Brave Clarice.

874
01:13:33,213 --> 01:13:36,774
那些羔羊停止尖叫时
你会告诉我的，是吗？
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

875
01:13:36,983 --> 01:13:38,814
说出他的名字
Tell me his name, doctor!

876
01:13:39,018 --> 01:13:40,315
克丽丝
Clarice!

877
01:13:41,688 --> 01:13:43,451
你的档案
Your case file.

878
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:46,217
喂！
Hey!

879
01:13:48,395 --> 01:13:49,885
再见，克丽丝
Goodbye, Clarice.

880
01:14:56,029 --> 01:14:57,792
医生，准备好就来吧
Ready when you are, doc.

881
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:00,291
请等一会
Just another minute, please.

882
01:15:09,142 --> 01:15:11,576
那个混蛋竟然要再吃晚饭
Son of a bitch demanded
a second dinner.

883
01:15:11,778 --> 01:15:13,609
还要极生的羊排
Lamb chops, extra rare.

884
01:15:13,813 --> 01:15:18,409
不知他早餐要吃什么？
动物园里的怪物？
Wonder what he wants for breakfast?
Some damn thing from the zoo?

885
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:29,650
（化学喷雾）

886
01:15:39,973 --> 01:15:41,440
两位，晚安
Good evening, gentlemen.

887
01:15:41,908 --> 01:15:43,603
好的，医生，蹲下吧
Okay, doc. Grab some floor.

888
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:45,869
跟以前的程序一样
Same drill as before, please.

889
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,017
庞毕探员，准备好了
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

890
01:16:11,604 --> 01:16:12,730
行了
Okay.

891
01:16:19,578 --> 01:16:21,045
递给我吧
Hand me that, would you?

892
01:16:26,785 --> 01:16:27,945
谢谢
Thanks.

893
01:16:31,856 --> 01:16:33,847
请小心那些画
Mind the drawings, please.

894
01:16:37,095 --> 01:16:38,119
谢谢你
Thank you.

895
01:17:02,687 --> 01:17:05,281
庞毕，小心，他把我扣住
Pembry, watch it, he's cuffed me!

896
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,363
天啊
Jesus Christ!

897
01:18:32,143 --> 01:18:34,577
庞毕探员，准备好就来吧
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

898
01:18:44,022 --> 01:18:45,956
究竟什么回事？
What is this shit?

899
01:18:48,426 --> 01:18:50,121
有人上了五楼？
Did somebody go up on five?

900
01:18:50,328 --> 01:18:54,128
-没有人上过去
-叫庞毕，叫他告诉...
-No, nobody went up.
-Call Pembry. Ask him to tell--

901
01:18:57,035 --> 01:19:01,096
CP，五楼有枪声
重复，五楼有枪声
CP, shots fired on five.
Repeat, shots fired on five.

902
01:19:01,306 --> 01:19:02,637
戴德警官
Sergeant Tate!

903
01:19:03,241 --> 01:19:04,868
去，五楼有枪声
Proceed. Shots fired on five.

904
01:19:05,443 --> 01:19:07,104
天啊！
Holy shit!

905
01:19:07,312 --> 01:19:09,109
-怎么了？
-混蛋！
-What the hell?
-Bitch!

906
01:19:09,481 --> 01:19:10,470
闭嘴！
Shut up!

907
01:19:10,749 --> 01:19:11,909
波比，拿避弹衣来
Bobby, get the vest.

908

958

拿了他的衣服和钞票

-他不会来对付我的

992
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:42,533
我不能解释
l can't explain it.

993
01:25:42,739 --> 01:25:44,969
他认为那样做很无礼
He would consider that rude.

994
01:25:45,442 --> 01:25:47,273
都完了，她已经死了
lt's over. She's dead.

995
01:25:47,477 --> 01:25:49,104
这不是你的错
lt's not your fault.

996
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:53,942
莱达说，我们需要捉拿他的资料

Lecter said everything we need to
catch him with is here, only l can't--

997
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,947
莱达医生说了很多话
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

998
01:25:56,686 --> 01:25:57,914
雅戴，他在这里的

999
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,518
这是莱达的笔迹吗？
ls this Lecter's handwriting?

1000
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:35,923
这样杂乱地分布现场
不是有点极度随意吗？
''Doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random?

1001
01:26:36,126 --> 01:26:39,926
像个差劲说谎者的精心策划？
汉内堡莱达
Like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Ta. Hannibal Lecter.''

1002
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:43,122
“极度随意”  ，他是什么意思？
''Desperately random.''
What does he mean?

1003
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:46,234
可能根本不是随意
是有一个模式的
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's a pattern here.

1004
01:26:47,337 --> 01:26:50,568
但并没有模式
不然电脑也会发现
But there's no pattern
or the computers would've nailed it.

1005
01:26:50,774 --> 01:26:53,208
尸体甚至是不依次序被发现的
They're even found in random order.

1006
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:57,244
不依次序是因为
那个被他沉下的女孩
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.

1007
01:26:57,681 --> 01:26:59,581

The first girl taken,
third body found. Why?

1010
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:09,217
她没有漂浮，他把她沉下去
She didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1011
01:27:09,426 --> 01:27:12,759
莱达说的首要原则是什么？
What did Lecter say
about the ''first principles''?

1012
01:27:12,962 --> 01:27:14,520
简易
Simplicity.

1013
01:27:14,731 --> 01:27:17,996
这个家伙做什么？他贪图
What does this guy do? He covets.

1014
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:20,692
我们怎样开始贪图的？
How do we first start to covet?

1015
01:27:20,904 --> 01:27:22,599
我们贪图见到的东西

1016

Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

1027
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:10,401

She left the interview okay.

1028
01:29:10,444 --> 01:29:12,036

She never come home.

他还懂得缝纫

He's a tailor or a dressmaker or--

1035
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:15,724
-史达琳！
-所以她们都身材肥大
-Starling!
-That's why they're big.

1036
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:18,160
他让她们活着，逼使她们挨饿
He keeps them alive
so he can starve them...

1037
01:32:18,365 --> 01:32:19,798
令她们的皮肤松弛，然后...
...loosen their skin and--

1038
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,525
史达琳

01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:27,339
-哪里？
-芝加哥卡柳梅特城
-Where?
-Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1041
01:32:27,541 --> 01:32:30,101
我45分钟后会和飞虎队降落
Be on the ground
in 45 minutes with HRT.

1042
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:32,506
好消息，但怎么...
That's great news, sir. But how--?

1043
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:36,274
我们把约翰霍金斯提供的名字
输入已知犯人的档案
We fed the names Johns Hopkins
came up with into Known Offenders.

1044
01:32:36,483 --> 01:32:40,419
他叫杰米甘姆，又名约翰格兰
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
a.k.a. John Grant.

1045
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:44,318
莱达的描述是正确的
他只是捏造那个名字
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.

1046
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:46,618
海关有些关于他的资料
Customs had some paper on him.

1047
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:49,887
两年前他们在洛杉矶机场
查到一个纸箱
They stopped a carton
two years ago at LAX.

1048
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,156
是一些来自苏里南的活毛虫
Live caterpillars from Suriname.

1049
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:55,358
收件人叫詹米甘姆
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1050
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,837
芝加哥离这里只有四百哩
我很快...
Chicago is only 400 miles from here.
l'll be there in--

1051
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:00,734
不，没有时间了
No, there's not enough time.

1052
01:33:00,941 --> 01:33:03,136
我们要控告他谋杀，不是绑架
We want him for murder,
not kidnapping.

1053
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:05,608
在起诉他前
要找出他与费迪嘉拜姆的关系
Link him to Bimmel
before he's indicted.

1054
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:09,840
-你去贝尔维迪尔看有什么发现
-知道，我会尽力的
-See what you can find in Belvedere.
-Yes, sir. You bet. l'll do my best.

1055
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:11,381
史达琳
Starling.

1056
01:33:11,785 --> 01:33:15,380
没有你我们就找不到他
大家都会记着这点
We wouldn't have found him
without you. Nobody will forget that.

1057
01:33:16,056 --> 01:33:17,648
尤其是我
Least of all me.

1058
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:19,886
谢谢，长官
Thank you, sir.

1059
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:22,426
谢谢你，葛先生
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1060
01:33:23,697 --> 01:33:25,130
葛先生？
Mr. Crawford?

1061
01:33:37,645 --> 01:33:39,943
混蛋，谢谢那些冷饭菜汁
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

1062
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:42,181
我有更好的主意
l got a better idea.

1063
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:06,165
珍宝，我来招呼你吧
Okay, Precious.

1068
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,307
我有好吃的点心给你

1069
01:34:42,509 --> 01:34:43,771
来吃吧

Come on, Precious.

1076
01:35:30,989 --> 01:35:32,479
你想干我吗？
Would you fuck me?

1077
01:35:32,925 --> 01:35:35,894
来吃骨头吧
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

（莫斯里药房）

1085
01:36:58,176 --> 01:37:02,078
当联邦密探很棒吧？
要经常出门的吗？
ls that a good job, FBl agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

1086
01:37:02,281 --> 01:37:04,442
我是指去比这里好的地方？
l mean, better places than this?

1087
01:37:06,251 --> 01:37:07,809
有时要的
Sometimes you do.

1088
01:37:08,687 --> 01:37:13,021
我找到这份银行工作时
费迪很替我开心

和整天播着巴尼曼尼罗的歌曲
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1090
01:37:17,362 --> 01:37:19,922
她觉得这是份苦差
She thought it was such hot shit.

1091
01:37:20,332 --> 01:37:22,630
她知道什么？蠢才
What did she know? Big dummy.

1092
01:37:22,834 --> 01:37:26,998
史戴西，费迪可有提过
一个叫杰米甘姆的男人？
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention
a man named Jamie Gumb?

1093
01:37:27,205 --> 01:37:28,866
或者詹米甘姆的人？
Or a Jame Gumb?

1094
01:37:29,641 --> 01:37:31,905
-约翰格兰呢？
-没有
-How about John Grant?
-No.

1095
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:34,442
她有没有一个你不认识的朋友？
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know?

1096
01:37:34,646 --> 01:37:37,206
不可能，如果她有男朋友
我一定会知道
No way. lf she had a guy,
l'd have known.

1097
01:37:37,416 --> 01:37:38,974
缝纫是她的命根
Sewing was her life.

1098
01:37:39,718 --> 01:37:41,276
你们有一起工作吗？
Did you ever work together?

1099
01:37:41,486 --> 01:37:46,219
我和玛娜茜曾替她
做利普曼太太的替工
Me and Pam Malavesi used to help her
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

-把它放在桶里
-不！
-Put her in that bucket.
-No!

1108
01:38:48,019 --> 01:38:50,886
你立刻给我吊个电话下来
You get me a telephone
and lower it down here, now!

1109
01:38:54,025 --> 01:38:57,984

Oh, poodlie-poo. Precious?
Darling, are you all right?

你别逼我伤害你的狗！
Don't you make me hurt your dog!

1114

你不知道什么是痛楚！

联邦调查局！大家伏下！
FBl! Everybody down!

1125

是，她很肥胖

对，我可能有...

1141
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:08,011
不，我在报纸上读到她的新闻
No, l read about her in the newspaper.

1142
01:41:09,858 --> 01:41:12,224
利普曼太太有儿子
他或许可以帮忙
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help.

1143
01:41:12,427 --> 01:41:14,156
我这里有他的名片

01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:39,177
你们快会抓到人吗？
Are you close to catching somebody?

1148
01:41:40,955 --> 01:41:41,944
是的
Yes.

1149
01:41:42,156 --> 01:41:43,350
或者吧
We may be.

1150
01:41:45,193 --> 01:41:46,387
你是不是...
Did you...

1151
01:41:47,328 --> 01:41:50,923
在利普曼太太死后搬到这里来？
...take over this place after
Mrs. Lippman died, is that right?

1152
01:41:52,233 --> 01:41:56,567
是的，我两年前买了这间屋
Yeah, l bought this house

没有，完全没有
No, nothing like that at all.

1156
01:42:10,151 --> 01:42:12,881
联邦调查局可有什么发现？
Say, has the FBl learned something?

1157
01:42:13,087 --> 01:42:16,488
这里的警方看来毫无头绪
The police around here don't seem
to have the first clue.

1158
01:42:26,067 --> 01:42:30,766
你们有没有容貌
指纹之类的线索？
Have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1159
01:42:32,206 --> 01:42:33,230

当然可以
Sure you can use my phone.

别动！

把双手放在头上，转过来
张开腿
Put your hands over your head
and turn around. Spread your legs.
